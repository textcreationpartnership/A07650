            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to diuers learned Gentlemen, and other my louing friendes.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout nineteene yeeres paſt (curteous Gentlemen) comming out of Spaine into my natiue countrey, and hauing ſpent welny three yeeres in ſome ſerious ſtudies and certaine affaires, with no meanes or occaſion to exerciſe the Spaniſh toong (by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance whereof it had almoſt ſhaken hands with me) it was my good hap to fall into the companie and acquaintance of my eſpeciall good friend <hi>Edward Banister</hi> of Ideſworth in the Countie of Southampton Eſquier; who perceiuing my remiſſenes in the ſaide language, perſwaded &amp; encouraged me earneſtly, by ſome good tranſlation to recal it to her former place: And to that intent he gaue me the firſt and ſecond Part of <hi>Diana</hi> of
<hi>Montemayor</hi> in Spaniſh, which Booke (although I had beene two yeeres in Spaine) till then I neuer ſaw nor heard of; whoſe friendly care and deſire to preuent ſo great a loſſe, and to preſerue ſuch an ornament in me, I confeſſe was the chiefe and principall cauſe (and therefore the onely credit) of this tranſlation, whereby I recouered that toong againe that lay (as it were) ſmothered in the cinders of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uion. The ſecond cauſe of this my labour, was the delight I paſſed in diſcurring moſt of thoſe townes and places in it with a pleaſant recordation of my pen, which mine eies ſo often with ioy and ſorrow had beheld. The third, the reſolued then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent I had neuer (howſoeuer now it hath eſcaped my hands) to put it in Print, in proofe whereof it hath lyen by me finiſhed <hi>Horaces</hi> ten and ſixe yeeres more. For till then I neuer tried my vnproper vaine in making an Engliſh verſe: how well or ill then the hard and ſtrange kinde of Spaniſh is turned, I leaue to your fauourable cenſure and pardon: The low and paſtorall ſtile hereof,
<hi>Montemayor</hi> in his Epiſtle to the L. of Villanoua excuſeth, entreating of Shepherds, though indeed they were but ſhadowes of great and honorable perſonages, and of their marriages, that not many yeeres agoe liued in the Court of Spaine, whoſe poſteritie to this day liue in noble eſtate. But touching the Bookes following, you muſt vnderſtand that
<hi>George</hi> of <hi>Montemayor</hi> a Gentleman ſprung out of the noble houſe of <hi>Montemayor</hi> in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, after he had ended his firſt Part of <hi>Diana,</hi> which he diſtributed into ſeuen Bookes, intending to ſet forth the ſecond Part, and before his departure into Italie (where I heard he died) imparted his purpoſe, and the ſubiect of his intended ſecond Part, to <hi>Alonſo Perez,</hi> who anſwering his intent, wrote the ſecond Part of <hi>Diana,</hi> contayning eight Bookes, promiſing in the end thereof to continue it with a third Part, which yet he hath not done, although I heare he hath a purpoſe to do it. But <hi>Gaſpar Gil Polo</hi> a Valentian Gentleman, who in my opinion excelleth for fine conceit (whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after that <hi>Alonſo Perez</hi> ſecond Part came forth) made another Part of <hi>Diana,</hi> naming it the firſt Part of Enamoured
<hi>Diana;</hi> the which being diuided into fiue Bookes, he intituleth to follow in due ſequence the firſt ſeuen Bookes of <hi>Diana</hi> of
<hi>George</hi> of <hi>Montemayor.</hi> And in the ende of that firſt Part of Enamoured <hi>Diana,</hi> he likewiſe maketh a reference to another Part which he promiſed to ſet foorth; the which and that of <hi>Alonſo Perez,</hi> if euer they come to light, I leaue to ſome finer wit and better iudgement to Engliſh, my ſelfe hauing done too much by launching ſo far into the maine, vnleſſe (happily) in your fauourable iudgements it may finde a <pb facs="tcp:23115:4"/>friendly and temperate conſtruction. Hauing compared the French copies with the Spaniſh originall, I iudge the firſt Part to be exquiſite; the other two corruptly done with a confuſion of verſe into Proſe, and leauing out in many places diuers hard ſentences, and ſome leaues in the end of the third Part, wherefore they are but blind guides by any to be imitated. Well might I haue excuſed theſe paines, if onely <hi>Edward Paston</hi> Eſquier (who heere and there for his owne pleaſure (as I vnderſtand) hath aptly turned out of Spaniſh into Engliſh ſome leaues that liked him beſt) had alſo made an abſolute and complete tranſlation of all the Parts of <hi>Diana;</hi> the which, for his trauell in that Countrey, and great knowledge in that language, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with other learned and good parts in him, had of all others, that euer yet I heard tranſlate theſe Bookes, prooued the rareſt and worthieſt to be embraced. The faults eſcaped in the Printing, the copie being verie darke and enterlined, and I loth to write it out againe, I pray you Gentlemen pardon, ſince all the laſt Terme that it was in the Preſſe (hauing matters of greater conſequence in charge) I could not intende the correction: aduertiſing you by the way that the greateſt faults are at the ende of the Booke ſet downe, the leſſe being of no moment purpoſely omitted. Fare ye well and continue me in your woonted loue and fauours.</p>

<hi>Leon</hi> in Spaine, lying along the bankes of the riuer <hi>Ezla,</hi> liued a Shepherdeſſe called <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe beautie was moſt ſoueraigne aboue all others in her time. She loued, and was deerely beloued againe of a Shepherd cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Syrenus,</hi> in whoſe mutuall loue was as great chaſtitie and vertue as might be. At the ſame time another Shepherd called <hi>Syluanus</hi> loued her alſo more then himſelfe, but ſo abhorred of the Shepherdeſſe, that there was not any thing in the world, which ſhe hated more. But it fell out, that as <hi>Syrenus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to be out of the kingdom about certaine affaires, which could by no means be excuſed, nor left vndone, and the Shepherdeſſe remaining at home very ſad for his abſence, time, and <hi>Dianas</hi> hart with time were chaunged, who then was married to another Shepherd called <hi>Delius,</hi> burying him, whom ſhe had but of late ſo greatly loued, in vniuſt obliuion. Who, after a whole yeere of his abſence comming home againe with great affection and deſire to ſee his beloued Shepherdeſſe, knew before he came, that ſhe was already married.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Owne from the hils of <hi>Leon</hi> came forgotten
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> whom loue, fortune, and time did ſo entreate, that by the leaſt greefe, that he ſuffered in his ſorrowfull life, he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for no leſſe then to looſe the ſame. The vnfortunate Shepherd did not now bewaile the harme, which her abſence did threaten him, and the feare of her forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes did not greatly trouble his minde, bicauſe he ſawe all the prophecies of his ſuſpicion ſo greatly to his preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice accompliſhed, that now he thought he had no more misfortunes to menace him. But the Shepherd comming to thoſe greene and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant meades, which the great riuer
<hi>Ezla</hi> watreth with his criſtalline ſtreames, the great felicitie and content came to his wandring thoughtes, which ſometimes he had enioyed there, being then ſo abſolute a Lord of his owne liberty, as now ſubiect to one, who had wrongfully enterred him in darke obliuion. He went muſing of that happie time, when in thoſe medowes, and on thoſe faire banks he fed his flocks, applying then his minde in the onely care and intereſt he had to feede them well: and ſpending the reſt of his howers in the onely delight, that he tooke in the ſweete ſmell of thoſe golden flowers, at that time eſpecially, when cheerefull ſpring-tyde (the merry meſſenger of ſommer) is ſpread ouer the face of the whole earth: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taking his rebecke, which he euer caried very neate in a ſcrip, and ſometimes his bagpipe, to the tune of which he made moſt ſweete ditties, which of all the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23115:6"/>Shepherdeſſes of thoſe hamlets thereabouts made him moſt highly commended. The Shepherd buſied not his thoughts in the conſideration of the proſperous and prepoſterous ſucceſſe of fortune, nor in the mutabilitie and courſe of times, neither did the painfull diligence and aſpiring minde of the ambitious Courtier trouble his quiet reſt: nor the preſumption and coye diſdaine of the proude and nice Ladie (celebrated onely by the appaſſionate vowes and opinions of her amorous ſutours) once occurre to his imaginations. And as little did the ſwelling pride, and ſmall care of the hawtie priuate man offend his quiet minde. In the field was he borne, bred, and brought vp: in the field he fed his flockes, and ſo out of the limits of the field his thoughts did neuer range, vntill cruell loue tooke poſſeſſion of his libertie, which to thoſe he is commonly woont to doe, who thinke themſelues freeſt from his tyrannie. The ſad Shepherd therefore came ſoftly on his pace, his eies turned into fountaines, the freſh hew of his face chaunged, and his hart ſo tempered to ſuffer Fortunes vnworthie diſgraces, that if ſhe would haue giuen him any content, ſhe muſt haue ſought him a new hart to receiue it. The weedes that he did weare, was a long gray coate, as rugged as his haps, carrying a ſheepehooke in his right hand, and a ſcrip hanging on his left arme. He laide himſelfe downe at the foote of a thicke hedge, and began to caſt foorth his eyes along thoſe faire riuer banks, vntill their beames came to that place, where firſt they beheld the beautie, grace, and rare vertues of the Shepherdeſle <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhe, in whom skilfull nature had conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated all perfections, which in euery part of her dainty body ſhe had equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Then did his hart imagine that, which before it diuined of, That ſometimes he ſhould finde himſelfe put amongſt ſorrowfull memories. And then could not the wofull Shepherd ſtop his teares from guſhing out, nor ſmother his ſighes which came ſmoking out of his breſt, but lifting vp his eies to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> began thus to lament. Ah memorie (cruell enemie to my quiet reſt) were not thou better occupied to make me forget preſent corſies, then to put before mine eies paſſed contents? What ſaieſt thou memorie? That in this medow I beheld my Lady
<hi>Diana,</hi> that in the ſame I began to feele that, which I ſhal neuer leaue of to lament, That neere to that cleere fountaine (ſet about with high and greene Sicamours) with many teares ſhe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſware to me, that there was not the deereſt thing in the world, no, not the will of her parents, the perſwaſion of her brethren, nor the importunities of her allies, that were able to remooue her from her ſetled thoughts? And when ſhe ſpake theſe words, there fell out of thoſe faire eies teares like orientall pearles, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to teſtifie that, which remained in her ſecret hart, commanding me, vpon paine to be accounted of her a man but of a baſe and abiect minde, if I did not beleeue that, which ſo often times ſhe had told me. But ſtay yet a little Memorie, ſince now thou haſt put before me the foundations of my miſhap (and ſuch they were, that the ioy, which I then paſſed, was but the beginning of the greefe which now I ſuffer) forget not to tune me this iarring ſtring, to put before mine eies by one and one, the troubles, the turmoiles, the feares, the ſuſpects, the iealouſies, the miſtruſts, and cares, which leaue not him, that moſt truly loues. Ah memorie, memorie, how ſure am I of this anſwere at thy hands, that the greateſt paine, that I paſſed in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, was but little in reſpect of that content, which in lieu of them I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Thou haſt great reaſon memorie, and the worſe for me that it is ſo great: and lying and lamenting in this ſort, he tooke a paper out of his boſome, wherein he had a few greene ſilken ſtrings and haire tyed vp together, and laying them open before him vpon the greene graſſe, with abundance of teares he tooke out his Rebecke, not <pb n="3" facs="tcp:23115:6"/>halfe ſo iocund as it was woont to be, at what time he was in <hi>Dianas</hi> fauour, and began to ſing that which followeth.</p>

               <p>Is this a letter ſaide <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſighing, to make one thinke, that obliuion could enter into that hart, from whence ſuch wordes came foorth? And are theſe wordes to be paſſed ſo ſlightly out of memorie? And that ſhe then ſpake them, and now forget me? O ſorrowfull man, with what great content did I reade this letter when my Miſtreſſe had ſent it me, and how many times in the ſame hower did I reade it ouer againe? But for euery pleaſure then, with ſeuen folde paine I am now apaide: and fortune could doe no leſſe with me, then to make me fall from one extreme to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For it had ill beſeemed her with partiall hand to exempt me from that, which to all others ſhe is commonly wont to doe.</p>
               <p>About this time from the hill beneath, that led from the village to the greene medowe, <hi>Syrenus</hi> might perceiue a Shepherd comming downe pace by pace, and ſtaying awhile at euery ſtep, ſometimes looking vp to heauen, and ſometimes caſting his eies vpon the greene medow and faire riuer bankes, which from aloft he might eaſily view and diſcouer (the thing which more augmented his ſorrow) ſeeing the place, where the beginning and roote of his miſhap did firſt growe. <hi>Syrenus</hi> knew him by and by, and looking towardes the place from whence he came, ſaide. Vnfortunate Shepherd (though not halfe ſo much as I am) that art a corriuall with me in

                  <hi>Syrenus</hi> was not idle when
<hi>Syluanus</hi> was ſinging theſe verſes, for with his ſighes he anſwered the laſt accents of his wordes, and with his teares did ſolemnize that, which he conceiued by them. The diſdained Shepherd after he had ended his ſong, began to reuolue in his minde the ſmall regarde he had of himſelfe, and how for the loue of his cruell <hi>Mistreſſe Diana,</hi> he had neglected all his buſines and flockes: and yet he reckoned all this but ſmall. He conſidered, that his ſeruice was without hope of recompence, a great occaſion to make him, that hath but ſmall firmneſſe, eaſily cut off the way of his loue. But his conſtancie was ſo great, that being put in the middes of all the cauſes, which he had to forget her, who neuer thought of him, with his owne ſafetie he came ſo eaſily out of them, and ſo cleerely without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the ſincere loue, which he bare his Shepherdeſſe, that (without any feare) he neuer committed any ignorance, that might turne to the hurt or hinderance of his faith. But when he ſawe <hi>Syrenus</hi> at the fountaine, he woondred to ſee him ſo ſad, not that he was ignorant of the cauſe of his ſorrow, but bicauſe he thought that if he had taſted but the leſt fauour, that
<hi>Syrenus</hi> had ſometimes receiued at <hi>Dianas</hi> handes, ſuch a contentment had bene ynough for him all his life time. He came vnto him and imbraced him, and with many teares on both ſides they ſat them downe vpon the greene graſſe, <hi>Syluanus</hi> beginning to ſpeake in this ſort. God forbid <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> that for the cauſe of my miſhap, or at the leſt for the ſmall remedie thereof, I ſhould take delight or reuenge in thine, which though at mine owne pleaſure I might well doe, yet the great loue which I beare to my Miſtreſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> woulde neuer conſent thereunto, nor ſuffer me to goe againſt that, which with ſuch good will and liking ſhe had ſometimes fauoured: if thy ſorrowes greeue me not, let me neuer haue end of mine; and in ſuch ſort, that as ſoone as
<hi>Diana</hi> was about to marry, if it killed not my hart with thinking, that her marriage and thy death ſhould haue bene both at one time, let me neuer enioy any other eſtate and condition of life then now I doe. Canſt thou then thinke <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> that I would wiſh thee ill, bicauſe
<hi>Diana</hi> loued thee? And that the fauours that ſhe did thee, were the occaſions to make me hate thee? What man, my faith was neuer ſo baſely poyſed, but that it was euer ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to my Miſtreſſe humour, not onely in louing thee, but in louing and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all that euer ſhe loued. And yet thou haſt no cauſe to thanke me for this care and compaſſion of thy greefe, for I am ſo diſſolued into cares, that for mine owne good I would be ſorie, how much more then for other mens harmes. This ſtraunge kinde of the Shepherd <hi>Syluanus</hi> his greeting cauſed no ſmall admiration in <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and made him for a while in ſuſpence with himſelfe, woondring at his great ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and at the ſtrange qualitie of his loue, that he did beare to his Shepherdeſſe. But remembring himſelfe at laſt, he ſaid. Haſt thou <hi>(Syluanus)</hi> happily, bene borne for an example of patience to thoſe, who know not how to ſuffer the aduerſities, that fortune puts before their eies? Or may it be, that nature hath giuen thee ſo ſtrong a minde, that it is not ynough for thee to ſuffer thine owne, but thou wilt needes helpe others to ſupport theirs? I ſee thee ſo conformable to the hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy fortune, that, promiſing thee no helpe of remedie, thou doeſt aske no other, then that it hath already giuen thee. I tell thee <hi>(Syluanus)</hi> that time ſhewes well by thee, how euery day it diſcouers nouelties and ſtraunge conceites beyonde the compaſſe of mans imagination. O how much more then ought this vnfortunate Shepherd to emulate thee, by ſeeing thee ſuffer thy greefes with ſuch content, which thou mighteſt rather haue done to him, when thou ſaweſt him ſo happily enioy his merry times. Haſt thou not ſeene how greatly ſhe fauoured me, and with <pb n="7" facs="tcp:23115:8"/>what ſweete and gracious wordes ſhe manifeſted her loue vnto me? Didſt thou not ſee, how ſhe could neuer goe with her flockes to the riuer, or take her lambes out of the folde, or in the heate of the day driue her ſheepe into the ſhades of theſe Sica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours without my companie? But for all this, I wiſh I may neuer ſee the remedie of my greefe, if I euer expected or deſired any thing at <hi>Dianas</hi> hands that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to her honour, or if any ſuch thing did euer paſſe my thought. For ſuch was her beautie, her braue minde, her vertue, and ſuch vnſpotted puritie in her loue to me againe, that they admitted no thought into my minde, which in preiudice of her goodnes and chaſtitie I might haue imagined. I beleeue it well (ſaide
<hi>Syluanus</hi> ſighing) for I can ſay as much by my ſelfe, and thinke moreouer that there was neuer any, that caſting his eies on <hi>Dianas</hi> peereleſſe beautie, durſt deſire any other thing, then to ſee her, and to conuerſe with her. Although I knowe not, whether ſuch rare and excellent beautie might in ſome mens thoughts (not ſubiect to ſuch a continent affection as ours) cauſe an exceſſiue deſire: and eſpecially, if they had ſeene her, as I did one day ſitting with thee neere to you little brooke, when ſhe was kembing her golden haire, and thou holding the glaſſe vnto her, wherein now and then ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her diuine figure, though neither of you both did (perhaps) knowe that I eſpied you from thoſe high buſhes, neere to the two great okes, keeping (yet) in minde the verſes, that thou ſungeſt vpon the holding of the glaſſe, whiles ſhe was addreſſing her reſplendant treſſes. How came they to thy handes, ſaide <hi>Syrenus?</hi> The next day following (ſaide
<hi>Syluanus</hi>) in that very place I founde the paper wherein they were written, and reading them, committed them to memorie: And then came
<hi>Diana</hi> thither weeping for the loſſe of them, and asking me, if I had found them, which was no ſmall ioy and contentment to me, to ſee my Miſtreſſe powre foorth thoſe teares, which I might ſpeedily remedie. And this I remember was the firſt hower, that euer I had a gentle and curteous word of her mouth (how greatly in the meane time ſtood I neede of fauours) when ſhe ſaide vnto me, that I might highly pleaſure her, to helpe her to that, which ſo earneſtly ſhe ſought for: which wordes, like holy relikes, I kept in my minde; for in a whole yeere after I tooke no regarde of all the woes and greefes that I paſſed, for ioy of that one onely word, which had in it but a ſmall apparance of ioy and happineſſe. Now as thou loueſt thy life (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) rehearſe thoſe verſes, which, thou ſaidſt, I did ſing, ſince thou haſt them ſo well by hart. I am content, ſaide <hi>Syluanus:</hi> and theſe they were.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Syrenus</hi> had heard the ſong out, he ſaide to
<hi>Syluanus.</hi> I wiſh that loue, gentle Shepherd, with hope of impoſſible felicitie may remedie my greefes, if there be any thing in the worlde, that I would ſooner chooſe to paſſe away my ſorrowfull life with, then in thy ſweete and gracious companie, and if it greeues me not now to the hart, that <hi>Diana</hi> is ſo cruell vnto thee, that ſhe hath not (which well ſhe might haue done) once thanked thee, nor ſhowen thee a fauourable and gratefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for all thy long and loyall ſeruice, and for ſo true loue that thou haſt ſhewed therein. I could with a little content me (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi> ſighing) if my angrie fortune would perſwade <hi>Diana</hi> to giue me ſome hope, which ſhe might well affoord without ſtaine to her honour, or breach of faith to thee. But ſo hard harted is ſhe, that not onely when I craue it, ſhe denies it me, and flies from me when I come in her ſight, but to comfort me with any ſmall ſigne or token, whereby I might imagine or hope hereafter to enioy it, ſhe would neuer yet conſent. Whereupon I ſaide many times to my ſelfe. It may fall out that this ſtonie harted and fierce Tygreſſe may one day conceiue ſome diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Syrenus,</hi> for reuenge whereof, and to deſpite him, ſhe will perhaps ſhew me ſome fained fauour; for ſo diſgraced and comfortleſſe a man as I am would be glad but with fained fauours to content him, and to imbrace them as true ones. And when thou wentſt out of this countrie, then I infallibly perſwaded my ſelfe, that the remedie of my greefe was knocking (as it were) at my doore, and that obliuion was the certaineſt thing to be expected after abſence, and eſpecially in a womans hart. But after when I ſaw her teares, her little reſt and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the village, her delight in ſeeking out ſolitarie places, and her continual ſighes, when I ſay I beheld all theſe things, God knowes with what impatience and greefe of minde I felt them. For though I knewe, that time was an approoued phiſition of ſorrow, which abſence is commonly woont to procure, yet I deſired not, that my Miſtreſſe might paſſe one hower of greefe, although I hoped to get thereby two thouſand of content. A few daies after thy departure I ſaw her at the foote of yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hill, leaning againſt an oke, and ſtaying her tender breſt vpon her ſheepehooke, where ſhe ſtood in that ſort a good while before ſhe eſpied me, who, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhe lifted vp her eies, yet her teares that iſſued out ſo faſt, did alſo hinder her (I thinke) that ſhe could not well perceiue me. She ſhould then be muſing on her ſolitarie and ſorrowfull life, and on the greefe that by thy abſence ſhe conceiued: But a little after that, not without many teares (accompanied with as many painfull ſighes) ſhe tooke out her bagpipe which ſhe caried in a fine ſcrip, and began to play on it ſo ſweetely, that the hils, and dales, the riuers, the enamoured birdes, and the rockie mountaines of that thicke wood were amazed and rauiſhed with her ſweete muſicke. And leauing her bagpipe, to the tune that ſhe had plaied, ſhe began to ſing this ſong following.</p>

Stay a little <hi>Syluanus,</hi> (I pray thee) and tell me what hart was able to chaunge, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elt ſuch paſſions? O conſtancie, O firmneſſe, how ſeldome and how ſmall a time doe you ſoiourne in a womans hart? That the more ſubiect ſhe is to loue and to imbrace you, the more ready ſhe is to leaue and forget you. And ſurely I was of this opinion, that this imperfection was incident to all women, but to my Miſtreſſe <hi>Diana,</hi> in whom I euer thought that nature had not omitted to frame euery good and perfect thing. But <hi>Syluanus</hi> after this proſecuting his hiſtorie, ſaide vnto him. When I came neere to the place where <hi>Diana</hi> was, I ſawe her fixing her faire eies in the cleere fountaine, where vſing her accuſtomed maner, ſhe began to ſay. O woefull eies, how ſooner ſhall you want teares to water my cheekes, then continuall occaſions to powre you out? O my <hi>Syrenus,</hi> I would to God, before the winter with his bluſtring ſtormes deſpoyles the greene medow of freſh and fragrant flowers, the pleaſant vallies of fine and tender graſſe, and the ſhadowed trees of their greene leaues, that theſe eies may behold againe thy preſence ſo much deſired of my louing ſoule, as mine is eſchewed and (perhaps) hated of thine: With this ſhe lifted vp her diuine countenance, and by chance eſpied me, and going about to diſſemble her ſorrowfull complaint, ſhe coulde not ſo cunningly doe it, but that her teares made it too manifeſt, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the paſſage of her diſſimulation. She roſe vp at my comming, and ſaide. Sit downe heere
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> and ſee how thou art now (to mine owne coſt) ſufficiently reuenged of me. Now doth this miſerable woman pay thee home againe thoſe paines, which thou didſt ſuffer (as thou ſaidſt) for her ſake, if it be true, that ſhe was euer, or yet is the cauſe of them. Is it poſſible <hi>Diana</hi> (ſaide I againe) that theſe eares may heare theſe wordes? In the end, I perceiue, I am not deceiued by ſaying, that I was borne to diſcouer euery day new kindes of torments for thy ſake, and thou to requite them with the greateſt rigour in the world. Doſt thou now therefore doubt, that thou art the cauſe of my greefe? If thou art not, who (doſt thou imagine) can deſerue ſo great loue as this: or what hart in the world (but thine) had not before this bene mollified and made pitifull by ſo many teares? And to theſe I added many other wordes, which now I doe not ſo well remember. But the cruell enemie of my reſt cut off my wordes, ſaying. If thy toong, <hi>Syluanus,</hi> fondly preſumeth to ſpeake to me againe of theſe matters, and not to entertaine the time with talke of my
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> I will (at thine owne pleaſure) leaue thee to enioy the delight of this faire fountaine, where we now ſit. For knoweſt thou not, that euery thing that intreates not of the goodnes of my Shepherd is both hatefull and hurtfull to my eares? And that ſhe, that loueth well, thinketh that time but ill imploied, which is not ſpent in hearing of her loue? Whereupon, fearing leaſt my wordes might haue bene an occaſion to haue made me looſe that great content and happines, that I had by her ſweete ſight and preſence, I ſealed them vp with ſilence, and was a good while without ſpeaking a worde, onely delighting my ſelfe with the felicitie I had, by contemplating her ſoueraine beautie, vntill night with greater haſte then I deſired, came on, when both of vs then were conſtrained to goe homewards with our flockes to our village. Then <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23115:11"/>
                  <hi>Syrenus</hi> giuing a great ſigh, ſaide. Thou haſt tolde me ſtrange things,
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> and all (wretched man) for the increaſe of my harmes, ſince I haue tried too ſoone the ſmall conſtancie that is in a womans hart, which for the loue that I beare to them all (for her ſake) in very trueth greeues me not a little. For I would not, Shepherd, heereafter heare it ſpoken, that in a moulde, where nature hath conioined ſuch ſtore of peregrine beautie, and mature diſcretion, there ſhould be a mixture of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy inconſtancie as ſhe hath vſed towards me. And that, which comes neereſt to my hart, is, that time ſhall make her vnderſtand, how ill ſhe hath dealt with me, which cannot be, but to the preiudice of her owne content and reſt. But how liues ſhe, and with what contentment after her marriage? Some tell me, ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> that ſhe brookes it but ill, and no maruell, for that <hi>Delius</hi> her husband though he be (as thou knoweſt) enriched with fortunes giftes, is but poore in thoſe of nature and good education: For, thou knoweſt, how lowtiſh of ſpirit and body he is, and namely for thoſe things, which we Shepherds take a pride in, as in piping, ſinging, wreſtling, darting of our ſheepehookes, and dauncing with the wenches on Sunday, it ſeemes that <hi>Delius</hi> was borne for no more, but onely to beholde them. But now good Shepherd, ſaid
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> take out thy Kit, and I will take my Bagpipe, for there is no greefe that is not with muſicke relented and paſſed away, and no ſorrow, which is not with the ſame againe increaſed. And ſo both the Shepherdes tuning, and playing on their inſtruments with great grace and ſweetneſſe began to ſing that which followeth.</p>

               <p>Not long after that the Shepherdes had made an ende of their ſorrowfull ſongs, they eſpied a ſhepherdeſſe comming out of the thicket neere to the riuer, playing on a Bagpipe, and ſinging with as ſweete a grace and delicate voice, as with no leſſe ſorrow and greefe, which by her countenance and geſture ſhe ſo liuely expreſſed, that it darkened a great part of her excellent beautie: Whereupon <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who had not of a long time fed in thoſe vallies, asked <hi>Syluanus</hi> what ſhe was, who anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: This is a faire Shepherdeſſe, that hath ſed but a fewe daies ſince in theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, complaining greatly of loue, and (as ſome ſay) with good cauſe, though others ſay, that ſhe hath bene a long time mocked by the diſcouerie of a deceite: Why, ſaide
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> lies it then in her to perceiue it, and to deliuer her ſelfe from it? It doth, ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> for I thinke there is no woman, though neuer ſo much in loue, whoſe wits and ſenſes the force and paſſion of loue can ſo much blinde, that may not perceiue whether ſhe be beloued againe or not. I am of a contrarie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſaide
<hi>Syrenus.</hi> Of a contrarie, ſaide <hi>Syluanus?</hi> Why, thou ſhalt not flatter thy ſelfe ſo much, for, the affiance which thou hadſt in
<hi>Dianus</hi> wordes, hath coſt thee deere, and yet I blame thee not, conſidering that as there is none, whom her beautie ouercomes not, ſo is there not any, whom her wordes deceiue not. How knoweſt thou that, ſince ſhe neuer deceiued thee by word nor deede. It is true, ſaide
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> that I was euer (if ſo I may terme it) vndeceiued by her, but I durſt (by that which hath hitherto fallen out) that ſhe neuer meant any deceit to me, but only to deceiue thee. But let vs leaue this, and harken to this Shepherdeſſe, that is a great friend to <hi>Diana,</hi> who is well worthy for the commendable report of her wiſedome and good graces to be harkened vnto. But now was the faire Shepherdeſſe comming towards the fountaine, and began to ſing this Sonnet following.</p>

               <p>After that the Shepherdeſſe had made an end of her ſong, ſhe came directly to the fountaine where the Shepherdes were, and while ſhe was a comming, <hi>Syluanus,</hi> ſmiling, ſaide. Marke but thoſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and the burning ſigh wherewith ſhe ended her ſong, what witneſſes they are of her inward loue and greefe. Thereof I haue no doubt, ſaide <hi>Syrenns,</hi> for I woulde to God I could ſo ſpeedily remedie her ſorrowe, as I beleeue (to my great greefe) all that ſhe hath by dolefull ſong vttered. And talking thus together, <hi>Seluagia</hi> was by this time come, and knowing the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, curteouſly ſaluted them, ſaying. What doe you in this greene and pleaſant medow, deſpiſed Shepherds? Thou ſaieſt not amiſſe, faire
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> by asking vs what we doe, ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> for we doe ſo little in reſpect of that we ſhoulde doe, that we can neuer conclude and bring any thing to paſſe, that in our loues we deſire to haue. Maruell not thereat, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> for there are certaine things, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ende, they that deſire them, are ended. True, ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> if a man puts his reſt in a womans diſpoſition, for ſhe will firſt ende his life, before ſhe will ende or determine to giue him any fauour, that he is ſtill hoping to receiue at her handes. Vnhappy women are theſe, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> that are ſo ill intreated by your wordes: But more vnfortunate are thoſe men, ſaide
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> that are worſe handled by your deedes. Can there be a thing more baſe and of leſſe account, then that you are ſo ready for the lighteſt thing in the worlde to forget them, to whom you haue borne the greateſt loue? For, abſent your ſelues but a day from him whom you loue well, and then ſhall he neede to commence his ſuite new againe. Two things I gather, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> by thy ſpeech, which make me wonder not a little. The one, to ſee thy toong goe ſo much awrie, and contrarie to that which I euer coniectured, and knew by thy behauiour and conditions. For I thought, when I heard thee talke of thy loue, that in the ſame thou wert a Phoenix, and that none of the beſt louers to this day came euer neere to the extreme that thou hadſt, by louing a Shepherdeſſe, whom I knowe, a cauſe ſufficient ynough not to ſpeake ill of women, if thy malice were not greater then thy loue. The ſecond, that thou ſpeakeſt of a thing thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt not; for to blame forgetfulnes, who neuer had any triall thereof, muſt rather be attributed to follie and want of diſcretion, then to any thing elſe. For if <hi>Diana</hi> did neuer remember thee, how canſt thou complaine of her obliuion? I thinke to anſwere, ſaide
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> both theſe pointes, if I ſhall not wearie thine eares with hearing me. To the firſt, ſaying, That I wiſh I may neuer enioy any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent then now I haue, if any (by the greateſt example that he is able to alleage me) can with wordes ſet downe the force and power, that this thankleſſe and diſloyall Shepherdeſſe, whom thou knoweſt, and I would I knew not, hath ouer my ſubiected <pb n="16" facs="tcp:23115:13"/>ſoule. But the greater the loue is I beare her, the more it greeues me, that there is any thing in her that may be reprehended. For heere is <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who was fauoured more of <hi>Diana,</hi> then any louer in the world of his Miſtreſſe, and yet ſhe hath now forgotten him, as thou faire Shepherdeſſe, and all we doe know. To the other point, where thou ſaieſt, that I haue no reaſon to ſpeake ill of that, whereof I neuer had experience, I ſay, that the Phiſition may iudge of that greefe, which he himſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had: and will further ſatisfie thee, <hi>Seluagia,</hi> with this opinion of me, that I beare no hate to women, nor (in very trueth) wiſh them ill, for there is nothing in the world, which I would deſire to ſerue with more reuerence and affection. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of my zealous loue, I am but ill intreated, and with ſuch intolerable diſdaine, which made me ſpeake ſo much by her, who takes a pride and a glorie in giuing me ſuch cauſe of greefe, <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who had held his peace all this while, ſaid to <hi>Seluaggia:</hi> If thou would'ſt but liſten to me, faire Shepherdeſſe, blameleſſe thou wouldeſt hold my riuall, or (to ſpeake more properly) my deere friend <hi>Syluanus.</hi> But tell me, what is the reaſon, that you are ſo inconſtant, that in a moment you throwe a Shepherde downe from the top of his good hap, to the deepeſt bottome of miſerie: knoweſt thou whereunto I attribute it? To nothing elſe but to your owne ſimplicitie: bicauſe you haue no perfect vnderſtanding to conceiue the good, nor knowe the value of that, you haue in your handes. You meddle with loue and are vncapable to iudge what it meanes; how doe you, then, knowe to behaue your ſelues in it. I tell thee, <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſaide
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> that the cauſe why Shepherdeſſes forget their louers, is no other, but bicauſe they are forgotten of them againe. Theſe are things, which loue doth make and vndoe, things which time and place alters and buries in ſilence, but not for the want of womens due knowledge in them, of whom there haue bene an infinite number in the world, who might haue taught men to liue, and to loue, if loue were a thing that might be taught or learned: But yet for all this, there is not (I thinke) any baſer eſtate of life then a womans; for if they ſpeake you faire, you thinke them by and by to die for your loue; if they ſpeake not to you, you thinke them proude and fantaſticall; if their behauiour be not to your liking, you thinke them hypocrites. They haue no kind of paſtaunce, which you thinke not to exceede: if they holde their peace, you ſay they are fooles: if they ſpeake, you ſay they are ſo troubleſome, that none will abide to heare them: if they loue you the moſt in the world, you thinke they goe about to deceiue you: if they forget you, and flie the occaſions of bringing their good names in queſtion, you ſay they are inconſtant, and neuer firme in one minde and purpoſe: So that the good or ill woman can doe no more to pleaſe your mindes, then neuer to exceede the limits of your deſires and diſpoſitions. If euery one faire <hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſaide
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> were indued with this fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of wit and graue vnderſtanding as thou art, they woulde neuer giue vs occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to make vs complaine of their ſmall regarde in their loue. But bicauſe we may knowe what reaſon thou haſt to finde thy ſelfe ſo much aggreeued with it, ſo may God giue thee comfort needefull for ſuch an ill, as thou wouldeſt vouchſafe to tell vs the ſubſtance of thy loue, and all the occurrents which haue hitherto befallen thee therein. For (it ſeemes) thou canſt tell vs more of ours, then we are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thee, to ſee, if his effects, which thou haſt paſſed, will giue thee leaue to ſpeake ſo freely as thou doſt: for by thy wordes thou ſeemeſt to haue more experience in them, then any woman that euer I knewe. If I were not the moſt tried woman in them, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> I am (at the leſt) the worſt intreated by them, as any euer was, and ſuch an one, who with greater reaſon then the reſt may complaine of loues <pb n="17" facs="tcp:23115:13"/>franticke effects (a thing ſufficient to make one ſpeake ynough in it.) And bicauſe by that which is paſt, thou maieſt knowe that which I now ſuffer, to be a diuelliſh kinde of paſſion, commit your misfortunes a while to ſilence, and I will tel you grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then euer you heard before.</p>
               <p>IN the mightie and inuincible kingdome of Portugall run two great riuers, which wearied with watring the greater part of our Spaine, not far from one another enter into the maine Ocean. Betweene both which are ſituated many olde and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient townes, by reaſon of the great fertilitie of the ſoile, which hath not the like in the whole world. The inhabitants liues of this prouince are ſo much ſequeſtred and eſtranged from things, that may diſturbe the minde, that there is not any (but when
<hi>Venus</hi> by the mightie handes of her blinde ſonne meanes to ſhew her power) who troubles his minde more, then to ſuſtaine a quiet life, by maintaining a meane and competent liuing with thoſe things, which for their poore eſtates are requiſite. The mens endeuours are naturally diſpoſed to ſpend their life time in ſufficient content, &amp; the womens beauties to take it from him, who liueth moſt aſſured of his libertie. There are many houſes in the ſhadowed forreſtes, and pleaſant vales, the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhed by the ſiluer deaw of ſoueraine heauen, &amp; tilled by their inhabitants, fauourable ſommer forgetteth not to offer vp into their handes the fruites of their owne trauels, and prouiſion for the neceſſitie of their liues. I liued in a village neere to great
<hi>Duerus</hi> one of theſe two riuers, where <hi>Minerua</hi> hath a moſt ſtately temple built vnto her, the which in certaine times of the yeere is viſited of all, or moſt of the Shepherdeſſes, that liue in that prouince: who, with the faire Nymphes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, begin, a day before the holy feaſt, with ſweete ſongs and hymnes to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate it, and the Shepherdes likewiſe to ſolemnize the ſame with challenges of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leaping, wreſtling, and pitching the barre, appointing ſeuerall rewardes and giftes for them, that beare the bell away, ſometimes a garland of greene Iuie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a fine Bagpipe, Flute, or Sheepehooke of knottie Aſhe, and other guerdons which Shepherdes make moſt account of. But the feſtiuall time being come, I with other Shepherdeſſes my friendes and acquaintance, leauing of our ſeruile and worke-day apparell, and putting on the beſt we had, went the day before to that place, determining to watch all that night in the temple, as other yeeres before we were wont to doe. Being therfore in companie of my friendes, we ſawe comming in at the doore a Beuie of faire Shepherdeſſes, attended on by iolly Shepherdes, who leauing them within, and hauing done their due oriſons, went out againe to the pleaſant valley: for the order of that prouince was, that no Shepherd might enter into the temple, but to doe his deuotion, and then preſently to goe foorth againe, vntill the next day, when all came in together to participate the ceremonies and ſacrifices, which were made there. The reaſon was, bicauſe the Shepherdeſſes and Nymphes might ſit alone, and without trouble or occaſion to thinke of any other matter, then deuoutly to celebrate the feaſt, and to make merry with one another, according to the ancient accuſtomed manner. And the Shepherdes to remaine amongſt themſelues without the temple in a faire greene meade hard by, where by the brightneſſe of nocturnall <hi>Diana</hi> they might diſport themſelues. But the foreſaid Shepherdeſſes being come into the ſumptuous temple (after they had ſaide a fewe prayers, and preſented their offerings vpon the altar) they placed themſelues downe by vs. And it was my ill hap, that one of them ſat next vnto me, to make me infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as long as her memorie did importune me. The Shepherdeſſes came in <pb n="18" facs="tcp:23115:14"/>muffled, for their faces were couered with white vailes tied vp aboue their hats, which were artificially made of fine ſtrawe, and ſo curiouſly wrought with many workes of the ſame, that it excelled the glittering golde in ſhew. But as I was eying her, that ſat next vnto me, I perceiued how ſhe did ſeldome caſt off her eies from beholding me againe; and when I looked on her, I might ſee her caſt them downe, fayning as though ſhe would ſee me, but in ſuch ſort, that I might not perceiue it. I did not meanely deſire to knowe what ſhe was, bicauſe, if ſhe had ſpoken to me, I might not vpon ignorance haue made a fault by not knowing her againe, who all the while that I ſat thinking of ſome other matter, did neuer caſt her eies off me, but viewed me ſo much, that a thouſand times I was about to ſpeake vnto her, being ſuddenly enamoured of thoſe faire eies, which of all her face were onely diſcouered and open. But ſhe ſeeing me ſitting in this perplexitie, pulled out the faireſt, and moſt dainty hand, that euer I did ſee, and taking mine into it, did with a ſweete and amorous eie a little while behold me: whereupon being now ſo ſtriken in loue, as toong cannot expreſſe, I ſaide vnto her. It is not onely this hand, moſt faire and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Shepherdeſſe, that is alwaies ready to ſerue thee, but alſo her hart and thoughts, to whom it appertaineth. <hi>Iſmenia</hi> (for ſo ſhe was called, that was the cauſe of my diſquiet and moleſted thoughts) hauing now complotted in her minde to mocke me (as you ſhall heare) anſwered me ſoftly, that none might heare her, in this manner, ſaying. I am ſo much thine, ſweete Shepherdeſſe, that, as ſuch an one, I boldly preſumed to doe that which I did, praying thee not to be offended with me, for no ſooner I viewed thy faire and amiable face, but preſently I loſt the power of my conquered ſoule: I was ſo glad to heare theſe wordes, that comming neerer vnto her, with a ſmile I anſwered her thus. How can it be, gentle Shepherdeſſe, that thy ſelfe being ſo paſſing faire, ſhouldeſt fal in loue with her, who wants it ſo much, to make her haue the name of ſuch an one, and more, with a woman as I am. It is that loue (faire Shepherdeſſe) ſaide ſhe againe, that ſeldome endes, ſuruiuing all deſtinies, and which is neither ſubiect to change of time, nor fortune. If the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my eſtate (ſaide I againe) could prompt me ſo fit an anſwere, as thy wiſe and diſcreete wordes doe inforce, the deſire which I haue to ſerue thee, ſhould not let me from manifeſting the ſame by moſt louing termes, but in theſe few ones beleeue me (faire Shepherdeſſe) that the reſolution which I haue to be thine, not death it ſelfe can determine, nor take away. After theſe wordes, our mutuall imbracings were ſo many, and our louing ſpeeches to one another ſo often redoubled, and of my part ſo true and vnfained, that we regarded not the Shepherdeſſes ſongs, nor beheld the daunces, nor other ſportes that were made in the temple. And now by this time was I earneſt with
<hi>Iſmenia</hi> to tell me her name, and to put off her muffler, both which not onely ſhe cunningly excuſed, but very ſuttly turned her talke to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter. But midnight being now paſt, and I hauing the greateſt deſire in the worlde to ſee her face, and to knowe her name, and of what village ſhe was, began to complaine of her, and to tell her, that it was not poſſible that the loue, which by her wordes ſhe proteſted to beare me, was ſo great, ſince hauing tolde her my name, ſhe concealed hers from me: and that louing her as I did, it was impoſſible for me to liue, vnleſſe I knewe whom I loued, or from whence I might heare newes from my loue againe, and many other things I tolde her in ſo good earneſt, that the ſame, and my teares helped to mooue falſe <hi>Iſmenias</hi> hart: who riſing vp and taking me by the hand, to carry me aſide into ſome ſecret place, where none might heare her, began to ſay theſe wordes vnto me, making as though
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23115:14"/>they came out from the bottome of her hart. Faire Shepherdeſſe, borne onely for the vnreſt and torment of a ſoule, that hitherto hath liued as exempt and free as poſſible might be, who can chooſe, but tell thee that thou requireſt at my handes, hauing now made thee the ſole Miſtreſſe of my libertie? Vnhappie me, that the chaunge of my habit hath deceiued thee, although the deceit redoundes to mine owne harme: The muffler, which thou intreateſt me to pull off, behold, to pleaſe thee, I take away, but to tell thee my name makes not much to thy purpoſe, when as heereafter (though I would not) thou ſhalt ſee me oftener then thou maieſt well ſuffer. And ſpeaking theſe wordes, and pulling off her muffler, mine eies behelde a face, whoſe countenance, though it was ſomewhat manlike, yet was the fauour and beautie of it ſo ſingular, that it made me to woonder. But <hi>Iſmenia</hi> proſecuting her ſpeech, ſaide. And bicauſe thou maiſt knowe (faire Shepherdeſſe) the ſumme of this paine which thy beautie hath made me feele, and that the wordes which haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed betweene vs but in ſport, are true, knowe, that I am a man, and not a woman, as thou takeſt me to be: Theſe Shepherdeſſes, which thou ſeeſt heere in my companie (my kinſwomen and familiar acquaintance) to make ſome ſport and to laugh, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled me in this ſort; for otherwiſe I could not haue ſtaied in the temple, by reaſon of the olde cuſtome ſo ſtrictly obſerued heere. When I heard theſe wordes, and perceiued as I ſaid before, not thoſe effeminate lookes in her face, nor that demure modeſtie in her eies, which maidens for the moſt part are woont to haue, I verily beleeued that all was true that ſhe tolde me, and then was ſo far beſides my ſelfe, that I knew not what to anſwere her. Yet mine eies did ſtill contemplate that moſt perfect beautie, and marked thoſe words, which with ſo great diſſimulation ſhe had tolde me: for neuer could any make a falſe and fained tale ſeeme more apparant and true as that craftie and cruell Shepherdeſſe did. Then I felt my ſelfe ſo intangled in her loue, and ſo well content to heare that ſhe was enamoured of me againe, as (gentle Shepherdes) I am not able to declare. And though I had not till then any experience of loue paſſions (a cauſe ſufficient not to make me expreſſe them) yet forcing my ſelfe the beſt I could, in this ſort I ſaide vnto her. Faire Shepherdeſſe, that haſt (to make me liue without libertie, or for ſome other reſpect, which fortune beſt knowes) taken vpon thee the habit of her, who for thy loue hath entirely vowed her affections to thee, thine owne had ſufficed to ouercome me, without making me yeelde with mine owne weapons. But who can flie from that, which fortune hath allotted her? Thriſe happy might I haue thought my ſelfe, if on purpoſe thou hadſt done that, which by chaunce, and onely for merriment thou haſt deuiſed. For, if by changing thy naturall habit, it had bene onely to haue ſeene me, and to vnfolde to me thy amorous deſires, I would then haue attributed it to mine owne deſertes, and (no doubt) to thy great affection, but ſeeing that the intent was of an other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, although the effect hath reſulted to this thou ſeeſt, it contents me not ſo greatly (I muſt needes confeſſe) being done in ſuch ſort as I haue ſaide. And let not this deſire amaze nor greeue thee; for there is no greater ſigne of a perfect louer, then to deſire to be beloued of him, to whom ſhe hath wholy offered vp her libertie. Whereupon by that thou haſt heard me vtter, thou maieſt gather, how thy ſight hath blinded my vnderſtanding, and made me become ſuch an one as I am, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thee to vſe the power thou haſt ouer me, in ſuch ſort, that I may entertaine this opinion, to thinke my ſelfe happie and fortunate to the end of our loue, the which for my part (while life doth laſt) ſhall not die in my faithfull and louing breſt. Deceitfull <hi>Iſmenia</hi> was ſo skilfull to frame a ſuttle anſwere to my ſimple wordes, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:23115:15"/>and to faine ſpeeches ſo fit for the ſubiect of our talke, that none coulde eſcape the cunning deceit, whereinto I fell, vnleſſe fortune by the threed of wiſedome had vnwound her out of ſo intricate a laberinth. And in this ſort we were together vntill morning came on, talking of that, which ſhe may imagine, that hath paſſed the like diſordered occurrents in loue. She tolde me her name was <hi>Alanius,</hi> her countrie village <hi>Gallia,</hi> three miles from our towne, where we appointed to meete, and ſee one another many times together. But now gan the duskie welkin to waxe cleere, and haſtie morning was come, when both of vs with many imbracings, teares, and ſighes were conſtrained to depart from one another. She went from me, and I, turning my head backe to beholde her, and to ſee if ſhe looked backe at me againe, perceiued how ſhe went away ſmiling to her ſelfe, whereof (thinking that mine eies did but deceiue me) I made no regarde at all. Away ſhe went with the companie that came with her, and I with more then I brought, ſince in my troubled minde I carried backe with me the eies and Idea of fained
<hi>Alanius,</hi> the wordes, by the which ſhe had opened to me her malicious and ridiculous loue, the imbracings, that I receiued of her, and the cruell greefe, which vntill that time I had neuer proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before. And now you muſt knowe (good Shepherdes) that this falſe and ſuttle <hi>Iſmenia</hi> had a coſin called <hi>Alanius,</hi> whom ſhe loued more then her ſelfe, for in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and eies, and in euery other part and lineaments, ſhe reſembled him ſo much, that if they had not bene of different ſexe, none could haue iudged the one from the other. And the loue which ſhe did beare him, was ſo great, that when I asked her her name in the temple, and ſeeing that ſhe muſt needes tell me ſome Shepherdes name or other, the firſt that came to her minde and mouth, was that of <hi>Alanius. For there is no greater certaintie, then that the toong in a ſudden matter doth euer concurre with the hart.</hi> And her the Shepherd loued well, but yet not ſo much as ſhe did him. But now when the Shepherdeſſes were come out of the temple, to goe home to their villages, <hi>Iſmenia</hi> went to her kinſman
<hi>Alanius,</hi> who, to ſhew her all the curteſie, that in ſo great and mutual loue was requiſite, leauing the yongſters companie of his towne, accompanied her all alone: whereat <hi>Iſmenia</hi> was not a little proude and ioyfull: who to entertaine the time with ſome talke by the way, tolde him all that had paſſed betweene vs, not omitting any thing, and not without great ſport and laughter of them both, telling him alſo, that I went away with firme beleefe, that ſhe was a man, and greatly enamoured of her. When
<hi>Alanius</hi> heard theſe nouelties, he diſſembled the matter the beſt he coulde, ſaying, that it was a pleaſant and pretie ieſt. And picking all out of her, that had paſſed betweene vs, ſo that (he thought) there was nothing left vntold, they came to their towne. But eight daies after (which I thought were eight thouſand yeeres) the traitour <hi>Alanius</hi> (for ſo I may with greater reaſon call him, then he had afterward to caſt me off) came to our towne, and ſtood attending me in ſuch a place, where I could not chooſe but ſee him, as I was going with other maides to the fountaine not far from the towne: whom when I eſpied, I was rapt out of minde for extreme and ſudden ioy, thinking he was the very ſame, that in the habit of a Shepherdeſſe had ſpoken to me in the temple; whereupon I made him ſome ſecret ſignes to come to the fountaine, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was going, who knowing my meaning, performed foorthwith my minde. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he came, and there we were talking together as long as time woulde giue vs leaue, and the loue (of my ſide at the leſt) was ſo ſtrongly confirmed betweene vs, that though the deceit had bene diſcouered (as not many daies after it was knowne) it was yet of ſo great force and vertue, that it coulde neuer make me alienate my <pb n="21" facs="tcp:23115:15"/>minde and affection from him. And I alſo beleeued, that <hi>Alanius</hi> loued me well, and that eſpecially from that time he was greatly enamoured of me, though afterwardes in effect he did not ſo well declare it: ſo that for certaine daies together our loue happily continued, and was handled with the greateſt ſecrecie that might be, which was not yet ſo great, but that ſubtile <hi>Iſmenia</hi> in the end perceiued it: who (ſeeing her ſelfe to be the onely cauſe thereof, and moſt in fault) not onely by deceiuing me, but by miniſtring occaſion to
<hi>Alanius</hi> of diſcouering himſelfe, and by that which paſſed, to fall in loue with me, and to forget her (as indeede he did) for very greefe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of her wits, but that with this poore hope ſhe comforted her ſelfe againe, that, if I knew the trueth, I would immediately forget and caſt him off, wherein ſhe was not a little deceiued: for as he afterwardes loued me more and more, ſo by his ſeuerall beauties and ſingular deſerts, I was more obliged to loue and honour him. But <hi>Iſmenia</hi> purpoſing to open the deceite, which by her owne follie and ſuttletie ſhe had framed, wrote me this letter following.</p>

I would put thee in ſome fault, for caſting thine eies vpon my <hi>Alanius,</hi> but (wretched woman) what ſhall I doe, that am the organ of mine owne miſhap. O
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> to my greefe I ſawe thee, and well could I excuſe that which I paſſed with thee, but in the end ſuch fonde prankes haue ſeldome good ſucceſſe. For laughing but one little hower with my
<hi>Alanius,</hi> and telling him what had paſſed betweene vs, I muſt now weepe and lament all my life time, if my greefe (at the leſt) may not mooue thee to ſome remorſe of pitie. I beſeech thee (by all I may) that the diſcouerie of this deceite may ſuffice, and ſo worke with thee, to make thee forget my <hi>Alanius,</hi> and reſtore this hapleſſe Shepherdeſſe to that, which (being not a little) thou art able to doe, if loue will permit thee to graunt me this fauour, which I requeſt at thy hands.</p>

                  <hi>Iſmenia</hi> could not reade this letter to the end, for in the middeſt of it her ſighes and teares, which ſhe powred out, were ſo many, that ſhe thought at that very time to haue loſt her life. She laboured (as much as ſhe could) to make <hi>Alanius</hi> forſake me, and deuiſed ſo many meanes for the ſame purpoſe, as he, to ſhun thoſe places and occaſions, whereby he thought he might ſee her. Not that he meant her any harme thereby, but bicauſe he thought (by doing ſo) in ſome part he requited the great loue that I bare him. All the daies that he liued in this minde, there eſcaped not any, wherein I ſawe him not; for he paſſed euermore that way, feeding his flockes, which from our towne did leade to his. He accounted no trauels nor trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles too great, which he did for my ſake, and eſpecially, if he thought I regarded them. Day by day
<hi>Iſmenia</hi> inquired after him, and neuer ceaſed to ſeeke him out, who being ſometimes tolde by others, and ſometimes knowing her ſelfe, that he was in our towne, had no patience at all to ſuffer ſuch a corſiue at her hart. And yet for all this, there was not anything, that contented and pacified her troubled minde more, then when ſhe could get ſome little time to ſpeake with him. <hi>But as neceſsitie is ſo ingenious and politike, that it ſeekes out remedies, where mans wit can ſcarce imagine any,</hi> deſpiſed <hi>Iſmenia</hi> aduentured to helpe her ſelfe by one, which I woulde to God had neuer entred into her thought, by faining that ſhe extremely loued another Shepherd called <hi>Montanus,</hi> who a long time had loued and ſerued her before. And as ſhe purpoſed, ſo ſhe put it in practiſe, to trie if by this ſudden change ſhe might draw
<hi>Alanius</hi> to that which ſo much ſhe deſired. <hi>For there is not any thing, which a man thinks he hath moſt ſure, though making but a ſmall account thereof, but that the loſſe of it (if on a ſudden he looſe it) doth not a little greeue him.</hi> But now when <hi>Montanus</hi> perceiued that faire <hi>Iſmenia</hi> his loue and Miſtreſſe had at laſt mollified her long ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate hart, and now thought good to requite the great loue that he had ſo long time borne her, Shepherdes, you may well imagine, what content he felt. For ſo great was his ioy, ſo obſequious his ſeruices to her, and ſo many troubles that he paſſed for her ſake, that they were an occaſion (with the disfauours and contempt that
<hi>Alanius</hi> had ſhewen her) to make that fained loue prooue true, which but in ieſt ſhe began to beare him. So that <hi>Iſmenia</hi> yeelded her hart wholy to <hi>Montanus</hi> with ſuch firmneſſe, that there was not any in the world, whom ſhe loued more then him, nor whom ſhe deſired leſſe to ſee then my <hi>Alanius:</hi> the which (as ſoone as ſhe could) ſhe gaue him to vnderſtand, thinking that as by theſe meanes ſhe was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently reuenged of his for getfulneſſe, ſhe had likewiſe buſied my head with the cruell thought therof. The loue that <hi>Alanius</hi> did beare me (although it greeued him to the hart to ſee <hi>Iſmenia</hi> loue that Shepherd, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in all his life time he could neuer abide)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23115:16"/>was yet ſo great, that he neuer ſeemed to make any ſhew of his ſecret greeſe. But certaine daies paſſing on, and thinking with himſelfe, that he onely was the cauſe of his enemies good hap, and of thoſe ſingular fauours, that <hi>Iſmenia</hi> ſhewed him, and that the Shepherdeſſe did now ſhun his ſight (who not long ſince before died for the want thereof) deſpite, wroth, and iealouſie at once ſo fiercely aſſailed him, that his impatience had almoſt bereft him of his wits, if preſently he had not determined to hinder <hi>Montanus</hi> his good fortune, or in the purſuite thereof to haue loſt his deereſt life. For performance whereof, he began to looke on <hi>Iſmenia</hi> againe, and not to come ſo openly in my ſight, as he was wont to doe, nor to be ſo often out of his towne, leaſt <hi>Iſmenia</hi> might haue knowen it. The loue betweene her and <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> went not on ſo forwardes, as that betweene me and my <hi>Alanius</hi> backwardes, though not of my part (when nothing, but death, was able to diuorce my minde from him) but of his, in whom I neuer thought to ſee ſuch a ſudden change: For ſo extremely he bumed with choler and rancour againſt <hi>Montanus,</hi> and ſo deepely enuied his good fortune, that (he thought) he could not execute nor aſſwage that anger, but by renewing the olde loue, that he bare to <hi>Iſmenia;</hi> for furtherance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his comming to out towne was a great impediment, whoſe abſence from me as it engendred forgetfulneſſe in him, ſo the preſence of his <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> rekindled his hart with a ſtraunger kinde of loue then before: whereupon he returned againe to his fuſt thoughts: And I (poore ſoule) remained all alone deceiued and ſcorned in mine owne affection. But all the ſeruice that he beſtowed on <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> the tokens and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that he ſent her, and the pitifull complaints that he made vnto her, or any thing els that he was able to doe, could neuer mooue her fetled minde, nor make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the leſt part of that loue, which ſhe bare <hi>Montanus.</hi> I being therefore loſt for the loue of <hi>Alanius, Alanius</hi> dying for <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> for
<hi>Montanus,</hi> it fell out, that my father had a certame occaſion of buſines about the buttals of certaine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures with <hi>Phylenus</hi> father to <hi>Montanus,</hi> by reaſon whereof both of them came often to our towne, and in ſuch a time, that <hi>Mont anus</hi> (whether it was for the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous fauours, that <hi>Iſmenia</hi> beſtowed on him (which to men of a baſe minde is a cloying) or whether he was too iealous of the renewed and earneſt ſuites of <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) waxed very colde in his loue to
<hi>Iſmenia.</hi> In the end when he eſpied me driuing my ſheepe to the folde, and with a curious eie looking on me, he began preſently to be enamoured of me, ſo that (by the effects which he daily ſhewed) it was not poſſible for me to beare greater affection to <hi>Alanius,</hi> nor
<hi>Alanius</hi> to <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> nor <hi>Iſmenia</hi> to
<hi>Montanus,</hi> nor <hi>Montanus</hi> to loue me more, then in very trueth he did. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde what a ſtrange couſinage of loue: If <hi>Iſmenia</hi> went by chaunce to the fielde, <hi>Alanius</hi> went after her; if
<hi>Montanus</hi> went to his flockes, <hi>Iſmenia</hi> after him; if I went to the hils with my ſheepe, <hi>Montanus</hi> after me; if I knew that
<hi>Alanius</hi> was in the wood, where he was wont to ſeede his flocks, thither I hied me after him. And it was the ſtrangeſt thing in the world to heart how <hi>Alanius</hi> ſighing ſaide, Ah my <hi>Iſmenia;</hi> and how
<hi>Iſmenia</hi> ſaide, Ah my <hi>Montanus;</hi> and how <hi>Montanus</hi> ſaid, Ah my <hi>Seluagia;</hi> and how <hi>Seluagia</hi> ſaide, Ah my
<hi>Alanius.</hi> It fell out afterwardes on a day, that we fower met together in a forreſt that lay betweene all our townes, and the reaſon was, bicauſe <hi>Iſmenia</hi> went to viſite certaine Shepherdeſſes of her acquaintance, which dwelt thereabouts, which when <hi>Alanius</hi> knew, being forced, and driuen on by his fleeting thoughts, he went after to ſeeke her out, and found her neere to a fine ſpring kembing her golden haire. I being tolde by a certaine Shepherd (my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout) that <hi>Alanius</hi> was gone to the forreſt of the valley (for ſo it was called) tooke <pb n="24" facs="tcp:23115:17"/>out before me a few goates, that were ſhut vp in a little yarde neere to our houſe, (bicauſe I would not goe without ſome errant) and went after him, where my deſire guided me; whom by chaunce I found weeping and complaining of his ill fortune, and the Shepherdeſſe laughing and ieſting at his bootleſſe teares, and ſighes. When <hi>Iſmenia</hi> eſpied me, ſhe was not a little glad of my companie, and began to be merry with me, although I had no cauſe to be ſo with her, to whom I rather obiected the ſmall reaſon, and leſſe regarde of modeſtie and diſcretion ſhe had, to greeue my hart with that vnciuill part and bad deceit; whereof ſhe ſo wiſely excuſed herſelfe, that whereas I thought ſhe would haue made me ſome amendes for all my greefe and ſorrow, by her wiſe and well ordered reaſons, ſhe gaue me to vnderſtand, that I was rather bound to her, in that if ſhe had mocked me, I had (ſaide ſhe) ſatisfied my ſelfe as well, and requited her againe, not onely by taking
<hi>Alanius</hi> her coſin from her, whom ſhe loued more then her ſelfe, but alſo by enticing <hi>Montanus</hi> to my loue, from that he was wont to ſhew her. By this time came <hi>Montanus,</hi> who was tolde by a Shepherdeſſe (a friend of mine) called <hi>Soliſa,</hi> that I was gone to the forreſt of the valley with my goates. And when all the fower diſcontented and diſcordant louers met there together, it cannot be imagined what we all felt: for euery one loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon another that would not haue bene viewed of thoſe eies againe. I asked my <hi>Alanius</hi> the cauſe of his forgetfulnes, he ſued for mercie at craftie
<hi>Iſmenias</hi> handes; ſhe accuſed and complained of the colde loue of
<hi>Montanus;</hi> he of <hi>Seluagias</hi> cruelty. Being therefore in this ſort (as you haue heard) euery one tormented for them, who loued them not againe, <hi>Alanius</hi> to the tune of his Fiddle by this dolefull ſong began to complaine of <hi>Iſmenias</hi> crueltie.</p>

After this euery one of vs went to their owne towne, bicauſe it was not meete for vs to be out of them at ſuch inconuenient and late howers. And the next day, my father (without telling me the cauſe why) caried me out of our towne, and brought me to yours, placing me there in the houſe of <hi>Albania</hi> mine aunt, and his ſiſter, whom you knowe well, where I haue remained a few daies ſince my comming hither, not knowing the cauſe of my ſudden exile, but haue heard of late, that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> hath married <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> and that <hi>Alanius</hi> was about to marrie a ſiſter of hers called <hi>Syluia:</hi> whereupon to conclude, I wiſh that he may liue (ſince it was not my good fortune to haue him) as ioyfull a life with his new ſpouſe, that nothing may want to the full accompliſhment of their content and happineſſe: For, the loue, which I beare him will ſuffer me no leſſe, then to wiſh him all the felicitie of this life.</p>

<hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaide vnto her. Great is thy greefe (faire

<hi>Seluagia</hi> came down from the hil, which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her towne did leade to a thick wood, driuing her gentle ſheepe and lambes before her: who, after ſhe had put them amongſt the lowe ſhrubs, which grew very thicke thereabouts, and ſeeing them buſie in knobbing the yoong and tender boughes, to ſtanch their hunger, went directly to the fountaine of the Sicamours, where the day before, in companie of the two Shepherds, ſhe had paſſed away the noone-tide heate: and ſeeing the place ſo agreeable to melancholie, and contemplation of her ſorrowes, ſhe thought it not amiſſe to take the opportunitie of the time, and place, and to ſit downe by the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whoſe waters ſeemed with her ſwelling teares to increaſe: where, after ſhe had a great while buſied her ſelfe in diuers and ſundrie thoughts, ſhe began thus to ſay. May it be poſſible <hi>Alanius,</hi> that thou art the man, whoſe eies I neuer ſaw dried vp from teares in preſence of mine? And he, who, falling downe ſo many times at my feete, with louing and pitifull wordes, craued mercie and clemencie at my handes, the which (to my great harme and greefe) I ſo gently beſtowed on thee? Tell me Shepherd (the falſeſt that liues on earth) is it true that thou louedſt me, to cloy thy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23115:20"/>minde, with my fauours, and ſo ſoone to be wearie of the loue that thou didſt beare me? Thou mighteſt imagine, that it was no leſſe in my power, to forget and deſpiſe thee, as thou haſt forgotten me. For it is the part of thoſe, that handle not their matters of loue ſo well as they ſhoulde, to thinke that their Miſtreſſes may play the like partes with them, as they haue done before; though ſome vſe it for a remedie and policie to make their loue encreaſe the more. And others, that iealouſie (the occaſion whereof moſt commonly they faine) may ſo captiuate their Miſtreſſes mindes, that (as they make them beleeue) they are not able to ſettle their affection in any other place: whereupon moſt of them come by little and little to manifeſt all that they fained before, whereby more cleerely they diſcouer their diſloyaltie. All which extremes at laſt reſult to the greefe and preiudice of vs poore ſoules, who (not conſidering how the endes of ſuch things commonly fall out) doe ſo deepely ſinke into that kinde of aſſured affection, that we neuer leaue of to loue you, nor you to requite vs with ingratitude and inconſtancie, as thou doſt that loue (diſloyall <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) which I haue borne, and doe ſtill beare thee. So that which of theſe thou haſt bene, I cannot coniecture. But wonder not <hi>Seluagia,</hi> that thou vnderſtandeſt ſo little in matters of diſdaine, that art ſo well practiſed in loues affaires. Thou didſt euer beare an honeſt and vertuous pretence by thy wordes, whereby I neuer looked for leſſe by thy deedes, which made me thinke, that that loue, (whereby thou mad'ſt me beleeue, that thy deſire extended to wiſh no more of me, then pure loue againe) ſhould neuer haue an end: for if any further drift had bene in thy deſires, I woulde neuer haue ſuſpected firmneſſe in thy loue. O wretched woman, how ſoone haue I begun to know thy intentions, and yet how late to preuent my harmes? Come thou to me my pretie Bagpipe, and with thee will I paſſe the time away: for had I ſpent it onely in thy exerciſe and delight, it had bene better for me: and after ſhe had plaied a while on it, ſhe began to ſing this

The diuerſitie of ſo many vnaccuſtomed mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaps, that daily harme vs woefull &amp; true louers cannot be (faire <hi>Seluagia</hi>) without griefe and compaſſion of minde conſidered. But amongſt them all, there is none (me thinks) that ought to be ſo much feared as that, which he ſuffers, who hath once
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23115:22"/>ſeene himſelfe in a good and ioyfull eſtate: the which by experience (as yeſterday thou didſt tell me) I neuer came yet to know: for the life (which I paſſe) is ſo far from reſt, and deliuered vp to ſorrowfull imaginations, that a thouſand times in vaine I ſeeke out new inuentions and means to deceiue and alter my taſt. For remedy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I do ſometimes think, That I am deerely beloued of my miſtreſſe, which thought (without opening any further paſſage to this fiction) I retaine as long as I can in my mind: but when I conſider afterwards the truth of my eſtate, I am ſo confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with my ſelfe, as I am not able to expreſſe it, and then (againſt my will) am voide of all patience: ſince then a bare imagination is not ſuch a thing, that may be ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, behold what the truth is able to do? I would to God <hi>(Syluanus)</hi> I were free (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) from this franticke paſſion that I might ſpeake the better in it, as in ſuch a caſe it were moſt needfull. For thou canſt not know any greater ſigne of loue, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be little or much, or of paſſion, whether it be ſmall or great, then by hearing her tell it, that feeles it: for a paſſion extremely felt can neuer be well manifeſted by her toong that ſuffers it. So that I (being ſubiect to my miſhap, and ſorrowfull for that diſgrace, which <hi>Alanius</hi> doth me) am not with words able to expreſſe the <hi>Chaos</hi> of griefe wherin I am ouerwhelmed. Wherefore I leaue it to thy conſideration and iudgement, as to things wherin I may put an aſſured confidence and truſt. I know not
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> what to ſay (replied <hi>Syluanus</hi> ſighing) nor what remedies we may hope for of our harms, doſt thou (perhaps) know any? How ſhould I not know (ſaid <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia</hi>) And wotteſt thou what it is? To leaue of to loue. And this maieſt thou do thy ſelfe (ſaid
<hi>Syluanus.</hi>) As fortune and time ſhall ordaine (ſaide
<hi>Seluagia.</hi>) Then I tell thee (ſaid <hi>Syluanus</hi> maruelling much) that thou needeſt not trouble thy ſelfe ſo much by complayning of thy griefe, bicauſe that loue, which is ſubiect to time and fortune, cannot be ſo extreme, to giue one any trouble or paine that ſuffers it. And canſt thou deny (ſaid <hi>Seluagia,</hi> againe) that it is not poſſible to haue an end in thy loue, either by death or abſence, or by being fauoured in ſome other place, where thy ſutes &amp; ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be more eſteemed, and better recompenced? I will not make my ſelfe (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) ſuch an hypocrite in loue, that I will not graunt, what thou ſaieſt may be poſſible, but not in me. For woe betide that louer, that (though he ſee ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune fall to others) would haue ſo little conſtancie in his loue, to thinke that any thing (contrary to his faith) may befall vnto him. I am a woman (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) and thou ſhalt ſee by me if I loue not as much as any may. And yet this offendes not my loue to thinke, that there may be an end of euery thing, be they neuer ſo firme and ſtrong, ſince it is the propertie of time and fortune with their vſuall changes to alter all things, as they haue euer done. And thinke not Shepherd, that any obliui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thought of his loue, that hath ſo iniuriouſly forgotten me, makes me ſpeake this, but that, which I haue ſeene by experience in theſe paſſions. And talking thus together they heard a Shepherd ſinging, as he came along the medow before them, whom they knew by and by to be the forgotten
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> who, to the tune of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becke came ſinging this Sonnet.</p>

When
<hi>Syrenus</hi> heard this, he was almoſt out of his wits, to ſee how the three Nymphes had knowledge of his miſhaps. But <hi>Cynthia,</hi> proceeding, ſaid. And among theſe riuer banks are many other faire Shepherdeſſes, and enamoured Shepherds, where loue hath ſhewed his mightie power and effects, and ſome cleane contrary to that they hoped for. This is a thing (ſaid <hi>Polydora,</hi> for ſo was the third called) not greatly to be maruelled at, bicauſe there is no ſucceſſe in loue, (be it neuer ſo prepoſterous) which may cauſe wonder in thoſe that haue paſſed his diſordinate effects.

               <p>But now the faire Nymphes, tooke vp their inſtruments, and went walking vp and downe the greene meadow, leſt of all ſuſpecting that, which happened vnto them: for hauing gone but a little way from the place, where the Shepherdes were ſecretly abiding, three monſtrous and foule Sauages came out of a thicket of high broome and buſhes on the right hande of the woode, armed with corſelets and morions of tygres skins, and ſo vgly to behold, that to the fearefull Nymphes it was a ſtrange and terrible ſight. The braces of their corſelets were at the endes armed with gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping mouthes of ſerpents, out of the which their armes ſhewed monſtrouſly great, and full of haire, and their morions that encompaſſed their griſely foreheads, with dreadfull heads of lyons, being naked in euery other part of their body, but that it was couered all ouer with long and thicke haire, and bearing in their rude hands clubs, armed with iron and ſharpe ſteeled points. At their neckes their bowes and arrowes, and likewiſe their ſhields, which were broad ſhels of monſtrous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſes were hanging downe behinde them: who with an incredible ſwiftnes ranne vpon the fearefull Nymphes, ſaying. Now is the time come (ingrate and ſcornefull Nymphes) that by our ſtrength and wils you ſhall be forced to do that, which our milde loue and longe ſuites could neuer bring to paſſe, for it is not reaſon that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhould doe ſuch iniurie to our captiue harts, with ſo long and great paine to defer our remedies. In fine, we haue now in our hands the guerdon of our ſighes and lamentations, which wearied the birds and beaſts of the darke and enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted woode, where we dwell: and the recompence of our burning teares, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we made the raging and lothſome riuer, that watreth the dreadfull fieldes and plaines of our territories to ſwell, and ouerflowe his banks: Since then you haue no other meanes to ſaue your liues, but by eaſing &amp; helping our harmes, be not ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full by reſiſtance, to make our cruell hands take vengeance of that paine, which ſo long you haue made our afflicted harts to feele. The Nymphes at the ſudden ſur-ſault of theſe monſters were ſo amazed, that they were not able to anſwer to theſe proude and cruell wordes, but onely with ſilence and teares. Albeit faire <hi>Doria,</hi> who had more courage then the reſt, at laſt did ſtoutly anſwer them thus againe. I neuer thought that loue could bring a louer to ſo foule an extreme, as with violent hands, and ſuch vnſeemly force to ſeaſe vpon his beloued. It is the manner of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to carie weapons, and fight with ſilly women, in an open and deſart fielde, where none is able to defend them, but their vertue, and honeſt reaſons. But of one thing (cruell &amp; vile beaſts) you may be aſcertained, that your menaces ſhal not make vs leeſe one iot of that, which our honours require, and that we will ſooner leaue our liues in your barbarous hands, then ſuffer our deer chaſtities by your beaſtly forces to be violated. It is needleſſe <hi>(Doria)</hi> (ſaide one of them againe) to harken to their reaſons, who had none at all to handle vs with ſo great ſcorne and crueltie: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <pb n="50" facs="tcp:23115:30"/>vnlooſing the ſtring from his bowe, that hung at his necke, he tooke her by both her faire hands, and rudely tied them togither, and ſo did his companions,
<hi>Cynthias</hi> and <hi>Polydoras.</hi> The two Shepherds and the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Seluagia,</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at the monſtrous violence of the Sauages, and ſeeing what beaſtialitie they beganne to vſe to the faire and tender Nymphes, not able to endure it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to die, or to defende them from their cruell handes. Wherefore all three taking out their ſlings, and filling their ſcrips with ſtones, came out of the woode, into the greene medowe, and beganne to throwe them at the Sauages with ſuch courage and dexteritie, as though their liues had lien in their handes; And thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to plie them ſo faſt with ſtones, that the Nymphes (while the Sauages were buſie about their owne defence) might eſcape, and ſaue their perſons from their vile immanitie, they redoubled their force, with the greateſt ſpeede and valour they coulde: Whoſe driftes the ſuttle Sauages ſuſpecting, one of them had an eie to the faire priſoners for running away, while the other two, by winning ground on their enemies, thought to make a quicke diſpatch of them. But the ſtones came ſo dangerouſly and ſo many, that they had ynough to defende themſelues, ſo that, as long as they laſted, the Sauages fared very ill. But as the Shepherdes were afterwardes occupied in ſtowping downe to take vppe more ſtones, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages came running in to them ſo ſpeedily with their maſſie clubs, that nowe they were without any hope of life, if preſently a certaine ſtrange Shepherdeſſe (of ſuch ſingular beautie and comely feature, as made both the Sauages and the reſt amazed at her goodly perſonage) had not come out of the thicke wood neere vnto the fountaine, where they before were ſinging. She had her bowe hanging on her left arme, and a quiuer of arrowes at her ſhoulder, in her hand a fine ſtaffe of wilde oke, armed at the end with a long and well ſteeled pike. But when ſhe ſaw the three Nymphes in ſo great diſtreſſe, and the effray betweene the two Sauages and the Shepherdes, who now looked for nothing more then preſent death, by putting quickly a ſharpe headed arrow into her bowe, with no meane force and skill ſhe ſhot it at one of the Sauages, leauing it halfe hidden in his hard breſt, whereby the arrow of loue, that pearced his hart loſt the force, and the Sauage his life. Neither was ſhe ſlowe in putting another in her bowe, nor leſſe skilfull in ſhooting it, for with the ſame ſhe as well ended the enamoured paſſions of the ſecond Sauage, as of the firſt. But ſetling her ſelfe to ſhoote at the third, that was keeping the three Nymphes, ſhe could not ſo ſoone effect it, but that he came running in to her, within the length of his club, and had ſurely diſpatched her with one blowe, if the faire Shepherdeſſe, by lifting vp her knottie ſtaffe (as he was diſcharging vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her) had not taken it vpon the iron point (whereby his club brake in two peeces) and immediately requited him with another vpon the top of his crowne, wherewith ſhe made him ſtagger on his knees, and then running a thruſt at his face (and with ſuch force and aime it was) that pearcing his eies, her ſtaffe made ſpeedie paſſage thorow his braines, ſo that the fierce. Sauage, yelling out a horrible and lowde grone, fell downe dead to the ground. The Nymphes ſeeing themſelues deliuered from ſo great violence, and the Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes from expected death, whereunto they were ſo neere, and how by the admirable valour and ſtrength of that Shepherdeſſe, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, but the Shepherdes had eſcaped, they were in a traunce for a while, and could not afterwardes imagine her to be any humane wight. But the Shepherdeſſe comming now vnto them, began to vntie their handes, ſaying. They deſerued no leſſe puniſhment, then that they haue (faire Nymphes) that with theſe rude and <pb n="51" facs="tcp:23115:30"/>rough bonds durſt preſume to binde ſuch white and delicate hands, whoſe beauties are fitter to binde tender and relenting harts. Accurſed be ſuch proude monſters, and ill befall to ſuch ſenſeleſſe and beaſtly men: but Ladies, they haue their hire, and I my deſire, by hauing done you this ſmall ſeruice, and comming in ſo good a time with ſpeedie remedie for ſuch an outrage, although theſe hardie Shepherdes, and faire Shepherdeſſe deſerue no leſſe thankes for hazarding their liues in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, who woulde (no doubt) like my ſelfe haue thought them well emploied, and themſelues well appaied, if in ſo good a quarrell, and for ſuch woorthy perſonages they had ioyntly loſt them. The Nymphes were no leſſe amazed at her rare beautie and wiſedome, then at the courage and force, that ſhe had ſhewed in their defence, whereupon <hi>Doria</hi> with a gratious ſemblant anſwered her thus againe. Faire Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, if thou art not (as by thy approoued valour and braue minde, thou ſeemeſt to be) the daughter of inuincible
<hi>Mars,</hi> yet for thy beautie (which is celeſtiall) thou muſt needes be the daughter of louely <hi>Venus</hi> and faire <hi>Adonis;</hi> and if of neither of them, it cannot then otherwiſe be, but that <hi>Minerua</hi> muſt be thy mother, ſince ſuch great wiſedome cannot proceed from any other part, although it is moſt true that nature hath endowed thee with the principall of them all. And ſince for ſo ſtrange a curteſie, and good turne that thou haſt done vs, extraordinarie and great muſt the ſeruices be, wherewith they muſt be requited, we hope, that at ſomtime or other, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be offered, wherein thou maieſt knowe, what earneſt deſire and entyre good wils we haue, to repaie ſo ſingular &amp; woorthie a fauor. But bicauſe (it ſeemes) thou art wearie, let vs go to the fountaine of the Sicamours, neere to yonder wood, where thou maiſt reſt and refreſh thy ſelfe. Let vs goe ladie (ſaid the Shepherdeſſe) not ſo much to eaſe my wearied body, as to talke of other matters, wherin my ſoules health and the ſumme of my content doth chiefely conſiſt. That will we do with all poſſible diligence (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) ſince there is not any, whom we ſhould with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon endeuor to content then thy ſelfe. But faire <hi>Cynthia</hi> turning to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes, ſaid. The debt (faire Shepherdeſſe, and ſtout Shepherds) wherein you haue perpetually bound vs to you, your ſelues know well ynough, which though we are neuer able to acquite, yet we will not ceaſe to wiſh, that ſome occaſion may heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fall out, wherein we may ſhewe the earneſt will and affection we haue to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, according to our great deſire. Theſe thankes (faire Nymphes) anſwered <hi>Seluagia,</hi> and your gentle offers, are more due to theſe two Shepherds then to me, that could do no more then praie for your ſafe deliuerie. But is this the Shepherd <hi>Syrenus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) ſo much beloued in times paſt, as now forgotten of the faire <hi>Diana?</hi> And is this other, his corriuall
<hi>Syluanus?</hi> They are the ſame (ſaide <hi>Seluagia.</hi>) Then am I glad (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) that you are ſuch kind of men, whom we may in ſome part recompence, the great good will you ſhewed, and the perill you paſſed to ſet vs free. <hi>Doria</hi> woondring at that ſhe had heard, ſaid. And is it true that this is <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus?</hi> I am very glad that I haue founde thee, and that there is an occaſion mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred me to ſeeke out ſome remedie (which (I hope) ſhall not be ſmall) for thy great cares and ſorrow. Nor ſufficient ynough for ſo great griefe, if it be ſmall (ſaide <hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>) Let vs go to the fountaine (ſaide
<hi>Polydora</hi>) where we will at large diſcourſe of theſe and other matters. To the which when they were come, the Nymphes, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Shepherdeſſe in the middes of them, ſat them downe, and the Shepherds at the Nymphes requeſts, went to the next towne to prouide ſome victuals, bicauſe it was now ſomewhat late, and that they all had an appetite to eate. But the three Nymphes remaining all alone with the vnknowne Shepherdeſle, faire <hi>Doria</hi> thus <pb n="52" facs="tcp:23115:31"/>began to ſay vnto her. It is no leſſe ſtrange to vs, to ſee ſuch an one as thou art (moſt valiant and faire Shepherdeſſe) of ſuch valour and ſtrength in theſe plaines and woods, ſequeſtred from all popular concourſe, then to thee (I thinke) to ſee three Nymphes heere all alone, and without companie to defend them from the like aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults. But bicauſe we may knowe what thou art (which is our chiefe deſire) we will inforce that fauour with this ſmall deſert, by telling thee firſt what we are, for the better knowledge wherof, thou ſhalt vnderſtand (couragious Shepherdeſſe) that this Nymph is called <hi>Polydora,</hi> that <hi>Cynthia,</hi> and my ſelfe
<hi>Doria,</hi> we hauing our manſion place in <hi>Dianas</hi> wood, where ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> keepes her ſtately court, whoſe courſe of life, and onely exerciſe, is to cure and remedie the paſſions of loue. We, going to viſit a certaine Nymph her couſin, that liueth on this ſide of the <hi>Gallician</hi> hils, came by chance to this pleaſant and ſhadowed dale, where, ſeeing the place fit to paſſe away the heate of the noone day, vnder the ſhadowe of theſe greene Sicamours and Laurell trees, and emulating the harmonie of this running ſpring, which paſſeth thorow this greene medow, we tooke our inſtruments, to ſee if we could imitate the ſame. And our hap (or rather miſhap) it was that theſe Sauages long ſince captiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as they ſay) in our loues, by chaunce came hither, who importuning vs many times with their brutiſh requeſtes, to graunt them our loue, and ſeeing that by no meanes we gaue them any hope thereof, with violent hands determined to put their beaſtly intents in practiſe; and finding vs heere all alone, did that, which (faire Shepherdeſſe) thou ſaweſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo fortunately thou cameſt to our reſcue. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe hearing what faire <hi>Doria</hi> had told her, with plentious teares gaue an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonie of the inward greefe, which her afflicted hart felt, and looking vpon the Nymphes, ſhe began thus to ſay.</p>
               <p>Loue is not ſuch a qualitie (faire Nymphes of the chaſte Goddeſſe) that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom it holdeth in captiuitie, can haue any regarde of reaſon, neither is reaſon a meanes to make an enamoured hart forſake that way, wherein the cruell deſtinies will conduct it. For proofe whereof, experience is at hand: for though you were loued of theſe cruell Sauages, and that the lawes of honeſt and pure loue doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite all iniuries, and whatſoeuer might offend you, yet on the other ſide, that head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long diſorder comes, wherewith it workes ſuch ſtrange and ſundrie effectes, that the ſame men, that ſhould ſerue and honour you, ſeeke to ſpoile and hurt you. And bicauſe you may knowe, that I am not vrged to ſay this, as onely induced by that, which now at my comming I haue ſeene in this vallie, I will tell you that, which I thought to conceale from all the world, but onely from him, to whom I yeelded vp long ſince the freedome of my hart, (if euer time and fortune grant mine eies ſuch fauour, that they may ſee him once againe) whereby you ſhal ſee how in the ſchoole of miſhaps I haue learned to talke of loues conſequences, and of the effectes, which the traitor works in their ſorrowfull harts, that are ſubiect vnto him.</p>
               <p>You ſhall therefore knowe (faire Nymphes) that great
<hi>Vandalia</hi> is my natiue countrie, a prouince not far hence, where I was borne, in a citie called <hi>Soldina,</hi> my mother called <hi>Delia,</hi> my father <hi>Andronius,</hi> for linage and poſſeſſions the chiefeſt of all that prouince. It fell out that as my mother was married many yeeres, and had no children, (by reaſon whereof ſhe liued ſo ſad and malecontent, that ſhe enioyed not one merry day) with teares and ſighes ſhe daily importuned the heauens, and with a thouſand vowes and deuout offerings beſought God to grant her the ſumme of her deſire: whoſe omnipotencie it pleaſed, beholding from his imperiall throne her continuall oriſons, to make her barren bodie (the greater part of her age being <pb n="53" facs="tcp:23115:31"/>now ſpent and gone) to become fruitfull. What infinite ioy ſhe conceiued thereof, let her iudge, that after a long deſire of any thing, fortune at laſt doth put it into her handes. Of which content my father
<hi>Andronius</hi> being no leſſe partaker, ſhewed ſuch tokens of inward ioy, as are impoſſible to be expreſſed. My mother <hi>Delia</hi> was ſo much giuen to reading of ancient hiſtories, that, if by reaſon of ſicknes, or any important buſineſſe, ſhe had not bene hindred, ſhe would neuer (by her will) haue paſſed the time away in any other delight: who (as I ſaid) being now with childe, and finding her ſelfe on a night ill at eaſe, intreated my father to reade ſomething vnto her, that, her minde being occupied in contemplation thereof, ſhe might the better paſſe her greefe away. My father, who ſtudied for nothing els but to pleaſe her in all he might, began to reade vnto her the hiſtorie of <hi>Paris,</hi> when the three Ladies referred their proude contention for the golden Apple, to his concluſion and iudgement. But as my mother held it for an infallible opinion, that <hi>Paris</hi> had partially giuen that ſentence, (perſwaded thereunto by a blinde paſſion of beautie) ſo ſhe ſaid, that without all doubt he did not with due reaſon and wiſedome conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goddeſſe of battels; for as martiall and heroicall feates (ſaide ſhe) excelled all other qualities, ſo with equitie and iuſtice the Apple ſhould haue bene giuen to her. My father anſwered, that ſince the Apple was to be giuen to the faireſt, and that <hi>Venus</hi> was fairer then any of the reſt,
<hi>Paris</hi> had rightly giuen his iudgement, if that harme had not enſued thereof, which afterwardes did. To this my mother replied, that, though it was written in the Apple, <hi>(That it ſhould be giuen to the fairest)</hi> it was not to be vnderſtood of corporall beautie, but of the intellectuall beautie of the mind. And therfore, ſince fortitude was a thing that made one moſt beautiful, &amp; the exerciſe of arms an exterior act of this vertue, ſhe affirmed, that to the Goddeſſe of battels this Apple ſhould be giuen, if <hi>Paris</hi> had iudged like a prudent &amp; vnappaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate iudge. So that (faire Nymphes) they ſpent a great part of the night in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, both of them alledging the moſt reaſons they could, to confirme their owne purpoſe. They perſiſting in this point, ſleepe began to ouercome her, whom the reaſons and arguments of her husband coulde not once mooue, ſo that being very deepe in her diſputations, ſhe fell into as deepe a ſleepe, to whom (my father being now gone to his chamber) appeered the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus</hi> with as frowning a countenance, as faire, and ſaide. I maruell <hi>Delia,</hi> who hath mooued thee to be ſo contrarie to her, that was neuer oppoſite to thee? If thou hadſt but called to minde the time, when thou wert ſo ouercome in loue for <hi>Andronius,</hi> thou wouldeſt not haue paide me the debt (thou oweſt me) with ſo ill coine. But thou ſhalt not eſcape free from my due anger; for thou ſhalt bring forth a ſonne and a daughter, whoſe birth ſhall coſt thee no leſſe then thy life, and them their contentment, for vttering ſo much in diſgrace of my honour and beautie: both which ſhall be as infortunate in their loue, as any were euer in all their liues, or to the age wherein with remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſighes they ſhall breath forth the ſumme of their ceaſeleſſe ſorrowes. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaide thus, ſhe vaniſhed away: when likewiſe it ſeemed to my mother that the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas</hi> came to her in a viſion, and with a merry countenance, ſaide thus vnto her. With what ſufficient rewardes may I be able to require the due regarde (moſt happie and diſcreete <hi>Delia</hi>) which thou haſt alleaged in my fauour againſt thy husbands obſtinate opinion, except it be by making thee vnderſtand, that thou ſhalt bring foorth a ſonne and a daughter the moſt fortunate in armes that haue bene to their times. Hauing thus ſaid, ſhe vaniſhed out of her ſight, and my mother thorow exceeding ſeare, awaked immediately. Who within a moneth after, at one <pb n="54" facs="tcp:23115:32"/>birth was deliuered of me, and of a brother of mine, and died in childebed, leauing my father the moſt ſorrowfull man in the world for her ſudden death, for greefe whereof within a little while after, he alſo died. And bicauſe you may knowe (faire Nymphes) in what great extremities loue hath put me, you muſt vnderſtand, that (being a woman of that qualitie and diſpoſition (as you haue heard) I haue bene forced by my cruell deſtinie to leaue my naturall habit, and libertie, and the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of mine honour, to follow him, who thinkes (perhaps) that I doe but leeſe it by louing him ſo extremely. Behold how booteleſſe and vnſeemely it is for a woman to be ſo dextrous in armes, as if it were her proper nature and kinde, wherewith (faire Nymphes) I had neuer bene indued, but that by meanes thereof, I ſhould come to doe you this little ſeruice againſt theſe villaines, which I account no leſſe then if fortune had begun to ſatisfie in part ſome of thoſe infinite wrongs, that ſhe hath continually done me. The Nymphes were ſo amazed at her words, that they coulde neither aske nor anſwere any thing, to that the faire Shepherdeſſe tolde them: who proſecuting her hiſtorie, ſaide. My brother and I were brought vp in a Nunnerie, where an aunt of ours was Abbeſſe, vntill we had accompliſhed twelue yeeres of age, at what time we were taken from thence againe, and my brother was caried to the mightie and inuincible <hi>King of Portugall</hi> his Court (whoſe noble fame and princely liberalitie was bruted ouer all the world) where, being growen to yeeres able to manage armes, he atchieued as valiant, and almoſt incredible enterpriſes by them, as he ſuffered vnfortunate diſgraces and foiles by loue. And with all this, he was ſo highly fauoured of that magnificent King, that he would neuer ſuffer him to depart from his Court. Vnfortunate I, reſerued by my ſiniſter deſtinies to greater miſhaps, was caried to a grandmother of mine, which place I would I had neuer ſeene, ſince it was an occaſion of ſuch a ſorrowfull life, as neuer any woman ſuffered the like. And bicauſe there is not any thing (faire Nymphes) which I am not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to tell you, as well for the great vertue and deſertes, which your excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe teſtifie, as alſo for that my minde doth giue me, that you ſhall be no ſmall part and meanes of my comfort; knowe that as I was in my grandmothers houſe, and almoſt ſeuenteene yeeres olde, a certaine yoong Gentleman fell in loue with me, who dwelt no further from our houſe, then the length of a garden Terraſſe, ſo that he might ſee me euery ſommers night, when I walked in the garden. When as therefore ingratefull <hi>Felix</hi> had beheld in that place the vnfortunate
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> (for this is the name of the wofull woman that tels you her miſhaps) he was extremely enamoured of me, or elſe did cunningly diſſemble it, I not knowing then whether of theſe two I might beleeue, but am now aſſured, that whoſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues leſt, or nothing at all in theſe affaires, ſhall be moſt at eaſe. Many daies <hi>Don Felix</hi> ſpent in endeuouring to make me know the paines, which he ſuffered for me, and many more did I ſpende in making the matter ſtrange, and that he did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them for my ſake. And I know not why loue delaied the time ſo long by forcing me to loue him, but onely that (when he came indeed) he might enter into my hart at once, and with greater force and violence. When he had therefore by ſundrie ſignes, as by Tylt and Tourneyes, and by prauncing vp and downe vpon his proude Iennet before my windowes, made it manifeſt, that he was in loue with me (for at the firſt I did not ſo well perceiue it) he determined in the end to write a letter vnto me, and hauing practiſed diuers times before with a maide of mine, and at length with many gifts and faire promiſes, gotten her good will and furtherance, he gaue her the letter to deliuer to me: But to ſee the meanes that <hi>Roſina</hi> made vnto me (for ſo was <pb n="55" facs="tcp:23115:32"/>ſhe called) the dutifull ſeruices and vnwoonted circumſtances, before ſhe did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it, the others that ſhe ſware vnto me, and the ſubtle words and ſerious proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhe vſed, it was a pleaſant thing, and woorthie the noting. To whom (neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe) with an angrie countenance I turned againe, ſaying. If I had not regard of mine owne eſtate, and what heereafter might be ſaid, I would make this ſhameleſſe face of thine be knowne euer after for a marke of an impudent and bolde minion. But bicauſe it is the firſt time, let this ſuffice that I haue ſaide, and giue thee warning to take heede of the ſecond. Me thinkes I ſee now the craftie wench, how ſhe helde her peace, diſſembling very cunningly the ſorrow, that ſhe conceiued by my angrie anſwer: for ſhe fained a counterfaite ſmiling, ſaying. Ieſus Miſtreſſe, I gaue it you, bicauſe you might laugh at it, and not to mooue your pacience with it in this ſort, for if I had any thought that it woulde haue prouoked you to anger, I praie God he may ſhew his wrath, as great towards me, as euer he did to the daughter of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And with this ſhe added many wordes more (as ſhe could do well enough) to pacifie the fained anger, and ill opinion that I conceiued of her, and taking her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with her, ſhe departed from me. This hauing paſſed thus, I began to imagine what might enſue thereof, and loue (me thought) did put a certaine deſire into my minde to ſee the letter, though modeſtie &amp; ſhame forbad me to aske it of my maide, eſpecially for the wordes, that had paſſed betweene vs, as you haue heard. And ſo I continued all that day vntill night, in varietie of many thoughts. But when <hi>Roſina</hi> came to helpe me to bedde, God knowes how deſirous I was to haue her entreat me againe to take the letter, but ſhe woulde neuer ſpeake vnto me about it, nor (as it ſeemed) did ſo much as once thinke thereof. Yet to trie, if by giuing her ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, I might preuaile, I ſaide vnto her. And is it ſo <hi>Roſina,</hi> that <hi>Don Felix</hi> without any regard to mine honour dares write vnto me? Theſe are things Miſtreſſe (ſaide ſhe demurely to me againe) that are commonly incident to loue, wherfore I beſeech you pardon me, for if I had thought to haue angred you with it, I woulde haue firſt pulled out the bals of mine eies. How cold my hart was at that blow, God knowes, yet did I diſſemble the matter, and ſuffer my ſelfe to remaine that night onely with my deſire, and with occaſion of little ſleepe. And ſo it was indeede, for that (me thought) was the longeſt and moſt painfull night, that euer I paſſed. But when with a ſlower pace (then I deſired) the wiſhed day was come, the diſcreet &amp; ſubtle
<hi>Roſina</hi> came into my chamber to helpe me to make me readie, in dooing whereof, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe let the letter cloſely fall, which when I perceiued, what is that that fell downe (ſaid I,) let me ſee it. It is nothing Miſtreſſe, ſaide ſhe. Come, come, let me ſee, it (ſaide I) what, mooue me not, or elſe tell me what it is. Good lord Miſtreſſe (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ide ſhe) why will you ſee it: it is the letter I would haue giuen you yeſterday. Nay that it is not (ſaide I) wherefore ſhew it me, that I may ſee if you lie or no. I had no ſooner ſaid ſo, but ſhe put it into my handes, ſaying: God neuer giue me good, if it be anie other thing; and although I knewe it well indeede, yet I ſaide, what, this is not the ſame, for I know that well enough, but it is one of thy louers letters, I will read it, to ſee in what neede he ſtandeth of thy fauour. And opening it, I founde it conteined this that followeth.</p>
               <p>I euer imagined (deere Miſtreſſe) that your diſcretion and wiſedome woulde haue taken away the feare I had to write vnto you, the ſame knowing well enough (without any letter at all) how much I loue you, but the very ſame hath ſo cunningly diſſembled, that wherein I hoped the onely remedie of my griefes had been, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſted my greateſt harme. If according to your wiſedome you cenſure my <pb n="56" facs="tcp:23115:33"/>boldnes, I ſhall not then (I know) enioy one hower of life: but if you do conſider of it according to loues accuſtomed effects, then will I not exchange my hope for it. Be not offended I beſeech you (good Ladie) with my letter, and blame me not for writing vnto you, vntill you ſee by experience, whether I can leaue of to write: And take me beſides into the poſſeſſion of that which is yours, ſince all is mine doth wholly conſiſt in your hands, the which with all reuerence and dutifull affection a thouſand times I kiſſe.</p>
               <p>When I had now ſeene my <hi>Don Felix</hi> his letter, whether it was for reading it at ſuch a time, when by the ſame he ſhewed, that he loued me more then himſelfe, or whether he had diſpoſition and regiment ouer part of this wearied ſoule, to imprint that loue in it, whereof he wrote vnto me, I began to loue him too well (and alas for my harme) ſince he was the cauſe of ſo much ſorrow, as I haue paſſed for his ſake. Whereupon asking <hi>Roſina</hi> forgiuenes of what was paſt (as a thing needfull for that which was to come) and committing the ſecrecie of my loue to her fidelitie, I read the letter once againe, pauſing a little at euery worde, (and a very little indeede it was) bicauſe I concluded ſo ſoone with my ſelfe, to do that I did, although in verie truth it lay not otherwiſe in my power to do. Wherefore calling for paper and inke, I anſwered his letter thus.</p>
               <p>Eſteeme not ſo ſlightly of mine honour, <hi>Don Felix,</hi> as with fained words to thinke to enueagle it, or with thy vaine pretenſes to offend it any waies. I know wel enough what manner of man thou art, and how great thy deſert and preſumption is, from whence thy boldnes doth ariſe (I geſſe,) and not from the force (which thing thou wouldſt faine perſwade me) of thy feruent loue. And if it be ſo, (as my ſuſpicion ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth) thy labor is as vaine, as thy imagination preſumptuous, by thinking to make me do any thing contrarie to that, which I owe vnto mine honour. Conſider (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee) how ſeldome, things, commenced vnder ſuttletie and diſſimulation, haue good ſucceſſe; and that it is not the part of a Gentleman, to meane them one way, and ſpeak them another. Thou praieſt me (amongſt other things) to admit thee into poſſeſſion of that, that is mine: but I am of ſo ill an humour in matters of this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that I truſt not things experienced, how much leſſe then thy bare wordes, yet neuertheleſſe, I make no ſmall account of that, which thou haſt manifeſted to me in thy letter; for it is ynough that I am incredulous, though not vnthankfull.</p>
               <p>This letter did I ſend, contrarie to that I ſhould haue done, bicauſe it was the occaſion of all my harmes and greefes: for after this, he began to waxe more bolde by vnfolding his thoughts, and ſeeking out the meanes to haue a parly with me. In the ende (faire Nymphes) a few daies being ſpent in his demaunds and my anſwers, falſe loue did worke in me after his wonted faſhions, euery hower ſeaſing more ſtrongly vpon my vnfortunate ſoule. The Tourneies were now renewed, the muſicke by night did neuer ceaſe, amorous letters and verſes were recontinued on both ſides: and thus paſſed I away almoſt a whole yeere, at the end whereof, I felt my ſelfe ſo far in his loue, that I had no power to retire, nor ſtay my ſelfe from diſcloſing my thoughts vnto him, (the thing which he deſired more then his owne life.) But my aduerſe fortune afterwardes would, that of theſe our mutuall loues (when as now they were moſt aſſured) his father had ſome intelligence, and whoſoeuer reuealed them firſt, perſwaded him ſo cunningly, that his father (fearing leaſt he would haue married me out of hand) ſent him to the great Princeſſe <hi>Augusta Caeſarinas</hi> court, telling him, it was not meete that a yoong Gentleman, and of ſo noble a houſe as he was, ſhould ſpende his youth idly at home, where nothing could be learned, but <pb n="57" facs="tcp:23115:33"/>examples of vice, whereof the very ſameidlenes (he ſaid) was the onely Miſtreſſe. He went away ſo penſiue, that his great greefe would not ſuffer him to acquaint me with his departure, which when I knew, how ſorrowfull I remained, ſhe may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that hath bene at any time tormented with like paſſion. To tell you now the life, that I led in his abſence, my ſadnes, ſighes, and teares, which euery day I powred out of theſe wearied eies, my toong is far vnable: if then my paines were ſuch, that I cannot now expreſſe them, how could I then ſuffer them? But being in the mids of my miſhaps, and in the depth of thoſe woes which the abſence of <hi>Don Felix</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me to feele, and it ſeeming to me that my greefe was without remedie, if he were once ſeene or knowen of the Ladies in that Court (more beautifull and gracious then my ſelfe.) By occaſion whereof, as alſo by abſence (a capitall enemie to loue) I might eaſily be forgotten, I determined to aduenture that, which I thinke neuer any woman imagined: which was, to apparell my ſelfe in the habit of a man, and to hye me to the Court to ſee him, in whoſe ſight al my hope and content remained: which determination, I no ſooner thought of, then I put in practiſe, loue blinding my eies and minde with an inconſiderate regarde of mine owne eſtate and condition. To the execution of which attempt, I wanted no induſtrie, for, being furniſhed with the helpe of one of my approoued friends, and treaſoureſſe of my ſecrets, who bought me ſuch apparell, as I willed her, and a good horſe for my iourney, I went not onely out of my countrie, but out of my deere reputation (which (I thinke) I ſhall neuer recouer againe) and ſo trotted directly to the Court, paſſing by the way many accidents, which (if time would giue me leaue to tell them) woulde not make you laugh a little to heare them. Twenty daies I was in going thither, at the ende of which, being come to the deſired place, I tooke vp mine Inne in a ſtreete leſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented with concurſe of people. And the great deſire I had to ſee the deſtroier of my ioy, did not ſuffer me to thinke of any other thing, but how or where I might ſee him. To inquire of him of mine hoſt, I durſt not, leſt my comming might (perhaps) haue bene diſcouered: and to ſeeke him foorth, I thought it not beſt, leſt ſome ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinate miſhap might haue fallen out, whereby I might haue bene knowen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I paſſed all that day in theſe perplexities, while night came on, each hower whereof (me thought) was a whole yeere vnto me. But midnight being a little paſt, mine hoſt called at my chamber doore, and tolde me if I was deſirous to heare ſome braue muſicke, I ſhould ariſe quickly, and open a window towards the ſtreet. The which I did by and by, and making no noiſe at all, I heard how <hi>Don Felix</hi> his Page, called <hi>Fabius</hi> (whom I knew by his voice) ſaide to others that came with him. Now it is time my Maſters, bicauſe the Lady is in the gallerie ouer her garden, taking the freſh aire of the coole night. He had no ſooner ſaide ſo, but they began to winde three Cornets and a Sackbot, with ſuch skill and ſweeteneſſe, that it ſeemed cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall muſicke. And then began a voice to ſing, the ſweeteſt (in my opinion) that euer I heard. And though I was in ſuſpence, by hearing
<hi>Fabius</hi> ſpeake, whereby a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand doubtes and imaginations (repugnant to my reſt) occurred in my minde, yet I neglected not to heare what was ſung, bicauſe their operations were not of ſuch force, that they were able to hinder the deſire, nor diſtemper the delight that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by hearing it. That therefore which was ſung, were theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>When this ſong was ended, they began to ſound diuers ſorts of inſtruments, and voices moſt excellently agreeing togither, and with ſuch ſweetnes, that they could not chuſe but delight any very much, who were not ſo farre from it as I. About dawning of the day the muſicke ended, and I did, what I could to eſpie out my <hi>Don Felix,</hi> but the darknes of the night was mine enimie therein. And ſeeing now that they were gone, I went to bed againe, where I bewailed my great miſhap, knowing that he, whom moſt of al I loued, had ſo vnwoorthily forgotten me, whereof his mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke was too manifeſt a witnes. And when it was time, I aroſe, &amp; without any other conſideration went ſtraight to the Princeſſe her pallace, where (I thought) I might ſee that, which I ſo greatly deſired, determining to call my ſelfe <hi>Valerius,</hi> if any (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) did aske my name. Comming therefore to a faire broad court before the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace gate, I viewed the windowes and galleries, where I ſawe ſuch ſtore of blazing beauties, and gallant Ladies, that I am not able now to recount, nor then to do any more, but woonder at their graces, their gorgeous attyre, their iewels, their braue faſhions of apparell, and ornaments, wherewith they were ſo richly ſet out. Vp and downe this place before the windowes roade many lords, and braue gentlemen in rich and ſumptuous habits, and mounted vpon proud Iennets, euery one caſting his <pb n="60" facs="tcp:23115:35"/>eie to that part, where his thoughts were ſecretly placed. God knowes how greatly I deſired to ſee <hi>Don Felix</hi> there, and that his iniurious loue had beene in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous pallace, bicauſe I might then haue beene aſſured, that he ſhoulde neuer haue got any other guerdon of his ſutes and ſeruices, but onely to ſee, and to be ſeene, and ſometimes to ſpeake to his Miſtreſſe, whom he muſt ſerue before a thouſand eies, bicauſe the priuilege of that place doth not giue him any further leaue. But it was my ill fortune, that he had ſetled his loue in that place, where I might not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of this poore helpe. Thus as I was ſtanding neere to the pallace gate, I eſpied
<hi>Fabius, Don Felix</hi> his page, comming in great haſte to the pallace, where ſpeaking a word or two with a porter that kept the ſecond entrie, he returned the ſame waie he came. I geſſed his errant was, to knowe whether it were fit time for <hi>Don Felix</hi> to come to diſpatch certaine buſines, that his father had in the court, and that he could not chooſe but come thither out of hand. And being in this ſuppoſed ioy, which his ſight did promiſe me, I ſawe him comming along with a great traine of followers attending on his perſon, all of them being brauely apparelled in a liuerie of watchet ſilke, garded with yellow veluet, and ſtitched on either ſide with threedes of twiſted ſiluer, wearing likewiſe blew, yellow, and white feathers in their hats. But my Lorde <hi>Don Felix</hi> had on a paire of aſh colour hoſe, embrodered and drawen foorth with watchet tiſſue, his dublet was of white ſatten, embrodered with knots of golde, and likewiſe an embrodered ierkin of the ſame coloured veluet, and his ſhort cape cloke was of blacke veluet, edged with gold lace, and hung full of buttons of pearle and gold, and lined with razed watchet ſatten, by his ſide he ware at apaire of embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hangers a rapier and dagger, with engrauen hilts and pommell of beaten golde. On his head, a hat, beſet full of golden ſtars, in the mids of euerie which a rich orient pearle was enchaſed, and his feather was likewiſe blew, yellow, and white. Mounted he came vpon a faire dapple graie Iennet, with a rich furniture of blew, embrodered with golde and ſeede pearle. When I ſawe him in this rich equipage, I was ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at his ſight, that how extremely my ſences were rauiſhed with ſudden ioye, I am not able (faire Nymphes) to tell you. Truth it is, that I could not but ſhed ſome teares for ioy and greefe, which his ſight did make me feele, but fearing to be noted by the ſtanders by, for that time I dried them vp. But as <hi>Don Felix</hi> (being now come to the pallace gate) was diſmounted, and gone vp a paire of ſtaires into the chamber of preſence, I went to his men, where they were attending his returne, and ſeeing
<hi>Fabjus,</hi> whom I had ſeene before amongſt them, I tooke him aſide, and ſaide vnto him. My friend, I pray you tell me what Lord this is, which did but euen now alight from his Iennet, for (me thinkes) he is very like one, whom I haue ſeene before in an other farre countrey. <hi>Fabius</hi> then anſwered me thus. Art thou ſuch a nouice in the court, that thou knoweſt not <hi>Don Felix?</hi> I tell thee there is not any Lord, knight, or gentleman better knowne in it then he. No doubt of that (ſaide I) but I will tell thee what a nouice I am, and how ſmall a time I haue beene in the court, for yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was the firſt, that euer I came to it. Naie then I cannot blame thee (ſaide <hi>Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) if thou knoweſt him not. Knowe then that this gentleman is called <hi>Don Felix,</hi> borne in Vandalia, and hath his chiefeſt houſe in the ancient cittie of Soldina, and is remaining in this court about certaine affaires of his fathers and his owne. But I pray you tell me (ſaid I) why he giues his liueries of theſe colours? If the cauſe were not ſo manifeſt, I woulde conceale it (ſaide <hi>Fabius</hi>) but ſince there is not any that knowes it not, and canſt not come to any in this court, who cannot tell thee the reaſon why, I thinke by telling thee it, I do no more then in courteſie I am bound to <pb n="61" facs="tcp:23115:35"/>do. Thou muſt therefore vnderſtand, that he loues and ſerues a Ladie heere in this Citie named <hi>Celia,</hi> and therefore weares and giues for his liuerie an azure blew, which is the colour of the skie, and white and yellow, which are the colours of his Lady and Miſtreſſe. When I heard theſe words, imagine (faire Nymphes) in what a plight I was, but diſſembling my miſhap and griefe, I anſwered him. This Ladie certes is greatly beholding to him, bicauſe he thinkes not enough, by wearing her colours, to ſhew how willing he is to ſerue her, vnleſſe alſo he beare her name in his liuerie: whereupon I geſſe, ſhe cannot be but very faire and amiable. She is no leſſe indeede (ſaide <hi>Fabius</hi>) although the other, whom he loued and ſerued in our owne countrey, in beautie farre excelled this, and loued and fauoured him more then euer this did. But this miſchieuous abſence doth violate and diſſolue thoſe things, which men thinke to be moſt ſtrong and firme. At theſe wordes (faire Nymphes) was I faine to come to ſome compoſition with my teares, which if I had not ſtopped from iſſuing foorth, <hi>Fabius</hi> could not haue choſen, but ſuſpected by the alteration of my countenance that all was not well with me. And then the Page did aske me, what countrey-man I was, my name, and of what calling and condition I was: whom I anſwered, that my countrey, where I was borne was Vandalia, my name <hi>Valerius,</hi> and till that time ſerued no Maſter. Then by this reckoning (ſaide he) we are both countrey-men, and may be both fellowes in one houſe if thou wilt: for <hi>Don Felix</hi> my Maſter commanded me long ſince to ſeeke him out a Page. Therefore if thou wilt ſerue him ſay ſo. As for meate, drinke, and apparell, and a couple of ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings to play away, thou ſhalt neuer want, beſides pretie wenches, which are not daintie in our ſtreete, as faire and amorous as Queenes, of which there is not anie, that will not die for the loue of ſo proper a youth as thou art. And to tell thee in ſecret (becauſe perhaps we may be fellowes) I know where an old Cannons maide is, a gallant fine girle, whom if thou canſt but finde in thy hart to loue and ſerue, as I do, thou ſhalt neuer want at her hands, ſine hand-kerchers, peeces of bacon, and now and then wine of S. <hi>Martyn.</hi> When I heard this, I could not chooſe but laugh, to ſee how naturally the vnhappie Page played his part, by depainting foorth their properties in their liuely colours. And becauſe I thought nothing more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for my reſt, and for the enioying of my deſire, then to follow <hi>Fabius</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, I anſwered him thus. In truth I determined to ſerue none, but now, ſince fortune hath offered me ſo good a ſeruice, and at ſuch a time, when I am conſtrained to take this courſe of life, I ſhall not do amiſſe if I frame my ſelfe to the ſeruiee of ſome Lord or Gentleman in this Court, but eſpecially of your Maſter, becauſe he ſeemes to be a woorthy Gentleman, and ſuch an one, that makes more reckoning of his ſeruants then an other. Ha thou knoweſt him not as well as I (ſaid <hi>Fabius</hi>) for I promiſe thee by the faith of a Gentleman (for I am one in deede, for my father comes of the
<hi>Cacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines</hi> of <hi>Laredo</hi>) that my Maſter <hi>Don Felix</hi> is the beſt natured Gentleman that euer thou kneweſt in thy life, and one who vſeth his Pages better then any other. And were it not for thoſe troubleſome loues, which makes vs runne vp and downe more, and ſleepeleſſe, then we woulde, there were not ſuch a Maſter in the whole worlde againe. In the end (faire Nymphes) <hi>Fabius</hi> ſpake to his Maſter <hi>Don Felix</hi> as ſoone as he was come foorth in my behalfe, who commanded me the ſame night to come to him at his lodging. Thither I went, and he entertained me for his Page, making the moſt of me in the worlde, where, being but a fewe daies with him, I ſawe the meſſages, letters, and gifts that were brought and caried on both ſides, greeuous wounds (alas &amp; coruiues to my dying hart) which made my ſoule to flie ſometimes
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23115:36"/>out of my body, &amp; euery hower in hazard to leeſe my forced patience before euery one. But after one moneth was paſt, <hi>Don Felix</hi> began to like ſo well of me, that he diſcloſed his whole loue vnto me from the beginning vnto the preſent eſtate and forwardnes, that it was then in, committing the charge thereof to my ſecrecie and helpe, telling me, that he was fauoured of her at the beginning, and that afterwards ſhe waxed wearie of her louing and accuſtomed entertainment, the cauſe whereof was a ſecret report (whoſoeuer it was that buzzed it into her eares) of the loue, that he did beare to a Lady in his owne countrey, and that his preſent loue vnto her was but to entertaine the time, while his buſines in the Court were diſpatched. And there is no doubt (ſaide <hi>Don Felix</hi> vnto me) but that indeede I did once commence that loue that ſhe laies to my charge, but God knowes if now there be any thing in the world, that I loue and eſteeme more deere and precious then her. When I heard him ſay ſo, you may imagine (faire Nymphes) what a mortall dagger pierced my wounded heart. But with diſſembling the matter the beſt I coulde, I anſwered him thus. It were better ſir (me thinkes) that the Gentlewoman ſhould complaine with cauſe, and that it were ſo indeed, for if the other Ladie, whom you ſerued before, did not deſerue to be forgotten of you, you do her (vnder correction my Lord) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wrong in the world. The loue (ſaid
<hi>Don Felix</hi> againe) which I beare to my <hi>Celia</hi> will not let me vnderſtand it ſo, but I haue done her (me thinkes) the greater iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, hauing placed my loue firſt in an other, and not in her. Of theſe wrongs (ſaide I to my ſelfe) I know who beares the woorſt away. And (diſloyall) he pulling a letter out of his boſome, which he had receiued the ſame hower from his Miſtreſſe, reade it vnto me, thinking that he did me a great fauour thereby, the contents whereof were theſe.</p>

Thou ſaieſt I was the cauſe that made thee forget thy former loue: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelfe, for there ſhall not want another to make thee forget thy ſecond. And aſſure thy ſelfe of this (Lord <hi>Don Felix</hi>) that there is not any thing more vnbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a Gentleman, then to finde an occaſion in a Gentlewoman to leeſe himſelfe for her loue.

               <p>After he had made an end of reading the letter, he ſaid vnto me. What thinkeſt thou <hi>Valerius</hi> of theſe words? With pardon be it ſpoken my Lord; That your deedes are ſhewed by them. Go to, ſaid <hi>Don Felix,</hi> and ſpeake no more of that. Sir, ſaide I, they muſt like me wel, if they like you, becauſe none can iudge better of their words, that loue well, then they themſelues. But that which I thinke of the letter is, that this Gentlewoman would haue beene the firſt, and that Fortune had entreated her in ſuch ſort, that all others might haue enuied her eſtate. But what wouldeſt thou counſell me ſaide <hi>Don Felix?</hi> If thy griefe doth ſuffer any counſell, ſaide I, that thy thoughts be diuided into this ſecond paſſion, ſince there is ſo much due to the firſt.
<hi>Don Felix</hi> anſwered me againe ſighing, and knocking me gently on the ſhoulder, ſaying. How wiſe art thou <hi>Valerius,</hi> and what good counſell doſt thou giue me, if I <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23115:36"/>could follow it. Let vs now go in to dinner, for when I haue dined, I will haue thee carie me a letter to my Lady <hi>Celia,</hi> and then thou ſhalt ſee, if any other loue is not woorthy to be forgotten in lieu of thinking onely of her. Theſe were wordes, that greeued <hi>Feliſmena</hi> to the hart, but bicauſe ſhe had him before her eies, whom ſhe loued more then her-ſelfe, the content, that ſhe had by onely ſeeing him, was a ſufficient remedie of the paine, that the greateſt of theſe ſtings did make her feele. After <hi>Don Felix</hi> had dined, he called me vnto him, and giuing me a ſpeciall charge what I ſhould do (becauſe he had imparted his griefe vnto me, and put his hope and remedie in my hands) he willed me to carie a letter to <hi>Celia,</hi> which he had alreadie written, and reading it firſt vnto me, it ſaid thus.</p>

                     <p>THe thought, that ſeekes an occaſion to forget the thing, which it doth loue and deſire, ſuffers it ſelfe ſo eaſily to be knowne, that (without troubling the minde much) it may be quickly diſcerned.

I haue confeſſed vnto you, that indeede I once loued well, becauſe that true loue, without diſſimulation, doth not ſuffer any thing to be hid, and you (deere Ladie) make that an occaſion to forget me, which ſhould be rather a motiue to loue me better. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade me, that you make ſo ſmall an account of your ſelfe, to thinke that I can forget you for any thing that is, or hath euer been, but rather imagine, that you write cleane contrarie to that, which you haue tried by my zealous loue, and faith towards you.

               <p>After <hi>Don Felix</hi> had read this letter vnto me, he asked me if the anſwer was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to thoſe words that his Ladie
<hi>Celia</hi> had ſent him in hers, and if there was any thing therein, that might be amended. Whereunto I anſwered thus. I thinke Sir, it is needleſſe to amende this letter, or to make the Gentlewoman amendes, to whom it is ſent, but her, whom you do iniurie ſo much with it. Which vnder your Lordſhips pardon I ſpeake, bicauſe I am ſo much affected to the firſt loue in all my life, that there is not any thing that can make me alter my minde. Thou haſt the greateſt reaſon in the world (ſaid <hi>Don Felix</hi>) if I coulde perſwade my ſelfe to leaue of that, which I haue begun: But what wilt thou haue me do, ſince abſence hath frozen the former loue, and the continuall preſence of a peereleſſe beautie rekindled another more hot and feruent in me. Thus may ſhe thinke her-ſelfe (ſaide I againe) vniuſtly deceiued, whom firſt you loued, becauſe that loue, which is ſubiect to the power of abſence, cannot be termed loue, and none can perſwade me that it hath beene loue. Theſe words did I diſſemble the beſt I could, becauſe I felt ſo ſenſible griefe, to ſee my ſelfe forgotten of him, who had ſo great reaſon to loue me, and whom I did loue ſo much, that I did more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any would haue thought, to make my ſelfe ſtill vnknowen. But taking the letter and mine errant with me, I went to <hi>Celias</hi> houſe, imagining by the way the wofull eſtate, whereunto my hapleſſe loue had brought me; ſince I was forced to make warre againſt mine owne ſelfe, and to be the interceſſour of a thing ſo contrarie to mine owne content. But comming to <hi>Celias</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:23115:37"/>houſe, and finding a Page ſtanding at the dore, I asked him if I might ſpeake with his Ladie: who being informed of me from whence I came, tolde <hi>Celia</hi> how I would ſpeake with her, commending therewithall my beautie and perſon vnto her, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her beſides, that
<hi>Don Felix</hi> had but lately entertained me into his ſeruice, which made
<hi>Celia</hi> ſaie vnto him. What, doth <hi>Don Felix</hi> ſo ſoone diſcloſe his ſecret loues to a Page, but newly entertained? he hath (belike) ſome great occaſion that mooues him to do it. Bid him com in, &amp; let vs know what he would haue. In I came, &amp; to the place, where the enimie of my life was, &amp; with great reuerence, kiſſing her hands, I deliuered <hi>Don Felix</hi> his letter vnto her. <hi>Celia</hi> tooke it, and caſting her eies vpon me, I might perceiue how my ſight had made a ſudden alteration in her countenance, for ſhe was ſo farre beſides her-ſelfe, that for a good while ſhe was not able to ſpeake a worde, but remembring her-ſelfe at laſt, ſhe ſaide vnto me. What good fortune hath beene ſo fauourable to <hi>Don Felix</hi> to bring thee to this Court, to make thee his Page? Euen that, faire Ladie, ſaide I, which is better then euer I imagined, bicauſe it hath beene an occaſion to make me behold ſuch ſingular beautie and perfections, as now I ſee cleerely before mine eies: And if the paines, the teares, the ſighes, and the continuall diſquiets, that my Lord
<hi>Don Felix</hi> hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, haue greeued me heeretofore, now that I haue ſeene the ſource, from whence they flow, and the cauſe of all his ill, the pittie, that I had on him, is now wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted into a certaine kinde of enuie. But if it be true (faire Lady) that my comming is welcome vnto you, I beſeech you by that, which you owe to the great loue, which he beares you, that your anſwer may import no leſſe vnto him. There is not anie thing (ſaide <hi>Celia</hi>) that I would not do for thee, though I were determined not to loue him at all, who for my ſake hath forſaken another. For it is no ſmall point of wiſedome for me, to learne by other womens harmes to be more wiſe, and warie in mine owne. Beleeue not good Lady (ſaide I) that there is any thing in the worlde, that can make <hi>Don Felix</hi> forget you. And if he hath caſt off another for your ſake, woonder not thereat, when your beautie and wiſedome is ſo great, and the others ſo ſmall, that there is no reaſon to thinke, that he will (though he hath woorthelie forſaken her for your ſake) or euer can forget you for any woman elſe in the worlde. Doeſt thou then know <hi>Feliſmena</hi> (ſaide <hi>Celia</hi>) the Lady whom thy Maſter did once loue and ſerue in his owne countrey? I know her (ſaide I) although not ſo well as it was needfull for me, to haue preuented ſo many miſhaps, (and this I ſpake ſoftly to my ſelfe). For my fathers houſe was neere to hers, but ſeeing your great beautie adorned with ſuch perfections and wiſedome, <hi>Don Felix</hi> can not be blamed, if he hath forgotten his firſt loue, onely to embrace and honour yours. To this did <hi>Celia</hi> anſwer merily, and ſmiling. Thou haſt learned quickly of thy Maſter to ſooth. Not ſo faire Ladie, ſaide I, but to ſerue you woulde I faine learne: for flatterie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be where (in the iudgement of all) there are ſo manifeſt ſignes and proofes of this due commendation. <hi>Celia</hi> began in good earneſt to aske me what manner of woman <hi>Feliſmena</hi> was; whom I anſwered, that touching her beautie, Some thought her to be very faire, but I was neuer of that opinion, bicauſe ſhe hath many daies ſince wanted the chiefeſt thing, that is requiſite for it. What is that ſaid <hi>Celia?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of minde, ſaide I, bicauſe perfect beautie can neuer be, where the ſame is not adioyned to it. Thou haſt the greateſt reaſon in the world, ſaid ſhe, but I haue ſeene ſome Ladies, whoſe liuely hewe ſadnes hath not one whit abated, and others, whoſe beautie anger hath encreaſed, which is a ſtrange thing, me thinkes. Hapleſſe is that beauty ſaid I, that hath ſorrow &amp; anger the preſeruers &amp; miſtreſſes of it, but I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not <pb n="65" facs="tcp:23115:37"/>skill of theſe impertinent things: And yet that woman, that muſt needes be mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with continuall paine and trouble, with greefe and care of minde, and with other paſſions to make her looke well, cannot be recknoed among the number of faire women, and for mine owne part, I do not account her ſo. Wherein thou haſt great reaſon ſaid ſhe, as in all things elſe that thou haſt ſaide, thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe wiſe and diſcreete. Which I haue deerely bought, ſaid I againe: But I beſeech you (gracious Lady) to anſwer this letter, becauſe my Lord <hi>Don Felix</hi> may alſo haue ſome contentment, by receiuing this firſt well emploied ſeruice at my hands. I am content, ſaide
<hi>Celia,</hi> but firſt thou muſt tell me if <hi>Feliſmena</hi> in matters of diſcretion be wiſe and well aduiſed? There was neuer any woman (ſaide I againe) more wiſe then ſhe, bicauſe ſhe hath beene long ſince beaten to it by her great miſhaps; but ſhe did neuer aduiſe her ſelfe well, for if ſhe had (as ſhe was accounted wiſe) ſhe had neuer come to haue bene ſo contrarie to her ſelfe. Thou ſpeakeſt ſo wiſely in all thy anſweres, ſaide <hi>Celia,</hi> that there is not any, that woulde not take great delight to heare them: which are not viands (ſaid I) for ſuch a daintie taſte, nor reaſons for ſo ingenious and fine a conceit (faire Lady) as you haue, but boldly affirming, that by the ſame I meane no harme at all. There is not any thing, ſaide <hi>Celia,</hi> whereunto thy wit cannot attaine, but becauſe thou ſhalt not ſpende thy time ſo ill in praiſing me, as thy Maſter doth in praying me, I will reade thy letter, and tell thee what thou ſhalt ſay vnto him from me. Whereupon vnfolding it, ſhe began to read it to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to whoſe countenance and geſtures in reading of the ſame, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times outwarde ſignes of the inwarde diſpoſition and meaning of the hart, I gaue a watchfull eie. And when ſhe had read it, ſhe ſaid vnto me. Tell thy Maſter that he that can ſo well by wordes expreſſe what he meanes, cannot chooſe but meane as well as he ſaith: And comming neerer vnto me, ſhe ſaide ſoftly in mine eare. And this for the loue of thee
<hi>Valerius,</hi> and not ſo much for <hi>Don Felix</hi> thy Maſter his ſake, for I ſee how much thou loueſt and tendereſt his eſtate: And from thence alas (ſaide I to my ſelfe) did all my woes ariſe. Whereupon kiſſing her hands for the great cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie and fauour ſhe ſhewed me, I hied me to <hi>Don Felix</hi> with this anſwer, which was no ſmall ioy to him to heare it, and another death to me to report it, ſaying manie times to my ſelfe (when I did either bring him home ſome ioyfull tydings, or carrie letters or tokens to her) O thriſe vnfortunate <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> that with thine owne wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons art conſtrained to wounde thy euer-dying hart, and to heape vp fauours for him, who made ſo ſmall account of thine. And ſo did I paſſe away my life with ſo many torments of minde, that if by the ſight of my <hi>Don Felix</hi> they had not beene tempered, it coulde not haue otherwiſe beene, but that I muſt needes haue loſt it. More then two monethes togither did <hi>Celia</hi> hide from me the feruent loue ſhe bare me, although not in ſuch ſort, but that by certaine apparant ſignes, I came to the knowledge thereof, which was no ſmall lighting and eaſe of that griefe, which inceſſantly haunted my wearied ſpirites; For as I thought it a ſtrong occaſion, and the onely meane to make her vtterly forget
<hi>Don Felix,</hi> ſo likewiſe I imagined, that, perhaps, it might befall to him, as it hath done to many, that the force of ingratitude, and contempt of his loue, might haue vtterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſuch thoughtes out of his hart. But alas it happened not ſo to my <hi>Don Felix,</hi> for the more he perceiued that his Ladie forgot him, the more was his minde troubled with greater cares and greefe, which made him leade the moſt ſorowfull life that might be, whereof the leaſt part did not fall to my let. For reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of whoſe ſighes and pitious lamentations, poore <hi>Feliſmena</hi> (euen by maine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23115:38"/>force) did get fauours from <hi>Celia,</hi> ſcoring them vp (whenſoeuer ſhe ſent them by me) in the catalogue of my infinite miſhaps. For if by chaunce he ſent her anie thing by any of his other ſeruants, it was ſo ſlenderly accepted, that he thought it beſt to ſend none vnto her but my ſelfe, perceiuing what inconuenience did enſue thereof. But God knowes how many teares my meſſages coſt me, and ſo many they were, that in <hi>Celias</hi> preſence I ceaſed not to powre them foorth, earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her with praiers and petitions, not to entreat him ſo ill, who loued her ſo much, bicauſe I woulde binde <hi>Don Felix</hi> to me by the greateſt bonde, as neuer man in like was bounde to any woman. My teares greeued <hi>Celia</hi> to the hart, as well for that I ſhed them in her preſence, as alſo for that ſhe ſawe, if I meant to loue her, I woulde not (for requitall of hers to me) haue ſollicited her with ſuch diligence, nor pleaded with ſuch pittie, to get fauours for another. And thus I liued in the greateſt confuſion that might be, amids a thouſand anxieties of minde, for I imagined with my ſelfe, that if I made not a ſhew that I loued her, as ſhe did me, I did put it in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, leſt
<hi>Celia,</hi> for deſpite of my ſimplicitie or contempt, woulde haue loue
<hi>Don Felix</hi> more then before, and by louing him, that mine coulde not haue any good ſucceſſe; And if I fained my ſelfe on the other ſide, to be in loue with her, it might haue beene an occaſion, to haue made her reiect my Lord <hi>Don Felix,</hi> ſo that with the thought of his loue neglected, and with the force of her contempt, he might haue loſt his content, and after that, his life, the leaſt of which two miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes to preuent, I woulde haue giuen a thouſand liues, if I had them. Manie daies paſſed away in this ſort, wherein I ſerued him as a thirde betweene both, to the great coſt of my contentment, at the end whereof, the ſucceſſe of his loue went on woorſe and woorſe, bicauſe the Loue, that <hi>Celia</hi> did beare me was ſo great, that the extreme force of her paſſion made her leeſe ſome part of that compaſſion, ſhe ſhould haue had of her ſelfe. And on a day after that I had caried, and recaried ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meſſages and tokens betweene them, ſomtimes faining ſome my ſelfe from her vnto him, becauſe I could not ſee him (whom I loued ſo deerly) ſo ſad and penſiue, with many ſupplications and earneſt praiers I beſought Lady <hi>Celia</hi> with pittie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the painfull life, that <hi>Don Felix</hi> paſſed for her ſake, and to conſider, that, by not fauouring him, ſhe was repugnant to that, which ſhe owed to her ſelfe: which thing I entreated, bicauſe I ſawe him in ſuch a caſe, that there was no other thing to be expected of him but death, by reaſon of the continuall and great paine, which his greeuous thoughts made him feele. But ſhe with ſwelling teares in her eies, and with many ſighes anſwered me thus. Vnfortunate and accurſed <hi>Celia,</hi> that nowe in the end doſt know, how thou liueſt deceiued with a falſe opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy great ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie (vngratefull <hi>Valerius</hi>) and of thy ſmall diſcretion. I did not beleeue till now, that thou didſt craue fauours of me for thy Maſter, but onely for thy ſelfe, and to enioy my ſight all that time, that thou diddeſt ſpende in ſuing to me for them. But now I ſee thou doſt aske them in earneſt, and that thou art ſo content to ſee me vſe him well, that thou canſt not (without doubt) loue me at all. O how ill doſt thou acquite the loue I beare thee, and that, which for thy ſake I do nowe forſake? O that time might reuenge me of thy proude and fooliſh minde, ſince loue hath not beene the meanes to do it. For I cannot thinke, that Fortune will be ſo contrarie vnto me, but that ſhe will puniſh thee for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temning that great good which ſhe meant to beſtow on thee. And tell thy Lord <hi>Don Felix</hi> that if he will ſee me aliue, that he ſee me not at all: And thou vile traitour, cruell enemie to my reſt, com no more (I charge thee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe wearied eies, ſince their teares were neuer of force to make thee knowe <pb n="67" facs="tcp:23115:38"/>how much thou art bound vnto them. And with this, ſhe ſuddenly flang out of my ſight with ſo many teares, that mine were not of force to ſtaie her. For in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt haſte in the worlde ſhe got her into her chamber, where locking the dore after her, it auailed me not to call and crie vnto her, requeſting her with amorous and ſweete words to open me the dore, and to take ſuch ſatisfaction on me, as it pleaſed her: Nor to tell her many other things, whereby I declared vnto her the ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe had to be ſo angrie with me, and to ſhut me out. But with a ſtrange kinde of furie ſhe ſaide vnto me. Come no more, vngratefull and proud <hi>Valerius</hi> in my ſight, and ſpeake no more vnto me, for thou art not able to make ſatisfaction for ſuch great diſdaine, and I will haue no other remedie for the harme, which thou haſt done me, but death it ſelfe, the which with mine owne hands I will take in ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that, which thou deſerueſt: which words when I heard, I ſtaied no longer, but with a heauie cheere came to my <hi>Don Felix</hi> his lodging, and with more ſadnes, then I was able to diſſemble, tolde him, that I could not ſpeake with <hi>Celia,</hi> becauſe ſhe was viſited of certaine Gentlewomen her kinſew omen. But the next day in the morning, it was bruted ouer all the citie, that a certaine trance had taken her that night, wherein ſhe gaue vp the ghoſt, which ſtroke all the court with no ſmal woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. But that, which <hi>Don Felix</hi> felt by her ſudden death, and how neere it greeued his very ſoule, as I am not able to tell, ſo can not humane intendement conceiue it, for the complaints he made, the teares, the burning ſighes, and hart-breake ſobbes, were without all meaſure and number. But I ſaie nothing of my ſelfe, when on the one ſide, the vnluckie death of <hi>Celia</hi> touched my ſoule very neere, the teares of
<hi>Don Felix</hi> on the other, did cut my hart in two with greefe: And yet this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that intollerable paine, which afterwardes I felt. For
<hi>Don Felix</hi> heard no ſooner of her death, but the ſame night he was miſſing in his houſe, that none of his ſeruants, nor any bodie elſe could tell any newes of him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon you may perceiue (faire Nymphes) what cruell torments I did then feele, then did I wiſh a thouſand times for death to preuent all thoſe woes and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, which afterwards befell vnto me: For Fortune (it ſeemed) was but wearie of thoſe which ſhe had but till then giuen me. But as all the care and diligence which I emploied in ſeeking out my <hi>Don Felix,</hi> was but in vaine, ſo I reſolued with my ſelfe to take this habite vpon me as you ſee, wherein it is more then two yeeres, ſince I haue wandred vp and downe, ſeeking him in manie countryes: but my fortune hath denied me to finde him out, although I am not a little now bounde vnto her by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting me hither at this time, wherein I did you this ſmall peece of ſeruice. Which (faire Nymphes) beleeue me, I account (next after his life in whom I haue put all my hope) the greateſt content, that might haue fallen vnto me.</p>
               <p>When the Nymphes had heard faire <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> tale, and vnderſtoode what a great Lady ſhe was, and how loue had made her forſake her naturall habite, and taken vpon her the weedes and life of a ſhepherdeſſe, they were no leſſe amazed at her conſtancie and zeale, then at the great power of that cruell tyrant, who abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commands ſo many liberties to his ſeruice. And they were mooued beſides to no ſmall pittie, to ſee the teares and burning ſighes wherewith the Ladie did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnize the hiſtorie of her loue. <hi>Doria</hi> therefore, whoſe tender ſoule <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> greefe did moſt tranſpierce, and who was more affected to her, then to any woman, with whom ſhe had ouer conuerſed before, tooke her by the hand, and began to ſay to her in manner follwing. What can we do (ſaire Lady) againſt the blowes of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, what place is there ſo ſtrong, where one may be ſafe from the mutabilities of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23115:39"/>time? What harneys ſo impenetrable, and ſteele ſo well tempered, that may ſerue for a defence againſt the violence of this tyrant, whom ſo vniuſtly they call <hi>Loue?</hi> And what hart (though it be harder then diamond) which an amorous thought can not mollifie and make tender? Certes this beautie, this valour, and this wiſedome, deſerue not to be forgotten of him, who had but once ſeene and knowne them: But we liue now in ſuch an age, that the deſerts of any thing, are the meanes and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of not obtaining it. And cruell loue is of ſo ſtrange a condition, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth his contents without any good order and rule, and giueth there greateſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, where they are leſt eſteemed; but the medicine of ſo many ils, (whereof this tyrant is the cauſe) is her diſcretion &amp; courage that ſuffers them. But whom doth he leaue ſo free, that theſe may ſerue her for a remedie? Or who can command her ſelfe ſo much in this paſſion, that in other womens affaires ſhe is able to giue counſell, how much leſſe to take it in her owne. Yet for all this, I beſeech thee (faire Ladie) to put before thine eies, and conſider what thou art, bicauſe if women of ſuch high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne and vertue as thou art, are not able to tolerate his aduerſe effects, how can they ſuffer them, that are not ſuch. And in the behalfe of theſe Nymphes and mine owne, I requeſt thee, to go with vs to the ſage <hi>Felicias</hi> pallace, which is not farre from this place, for that to morrow about this time we may be well there: where (I am aſſured) thou ſhalt finde great remedies for thy greefes, as many others haue done heeretofore, that haue not deſerued them as much as thou haſt: whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde skill and rare experiments (beſides many other notable things in her, wherein no man or woman in our times came euer neere her) and her princely bountie doth'make her ſo famous and renowned, that the greateſt kings and eſtates in the worlde are deſirous of her companie. I know not faire Nymphes (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi> againe) who is able to applie a remedie to ſuch an ill, but he that firſt cauſed it. But neuertheleſſe I will fulfill your wils heerein, and ſince your companie is ſuch an eaſe and lighting to my paine, it were a fond part to reiect that comfort, whereof at this time I ſtande in ſo great neede. I woonder ſaid <hi>Cynthia,</hi> that <hi>Don Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> (al the while thou didſt ſerue him) did not know thee by thy faire face, thy ſweete grace, and looking daily on ſuch faire eies. He did ſo little remember thoſe beauties, ſaide <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> which he had once ſcene in me, (his thoughts being ſo deepely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on <hi>Celias</hi> which he daily viewed) that he had no power, nor knowledge left to thinke once of mine. And talking thus togither, they heard the Shepherds ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (that in companie of diſcreet <hi>Seluagia</hi> were comming down the hill) the oldeſt ſongs they knew, or that their ſeuerall greefes did put into their heads, euerie one taking that, which made moſt for his purpoſe. And the firſt that began to ſing, was <hi>Syluanus,</hi> who did ſing this ſong following.</p>

When they were come to the fountaine, and had done their due reuerence, they ſpred a faire white cloth vpon the greene graſſe, and ſetting that meate on it, which they had brought with them from the towne, they ſat them downe to eate, whom their thoughts (at leſt) would giue leaue, and they, (who had not ſuch a priuiledge) impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by them, that were moſt free, muſt needes do the like. And after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed themſelues, <hi>Polydora</hi> ſaide thus.

And thou <hi>Syrenus,</hi> whom Fortune hath toſſed from a happie and ioyfull time, to a life as hapleſſe and full of ſorrowe, deſpaire not, but cheere vp thy ſelfe, for if thy Miſtreſſe had the remedie of the miſerable life, which ſhe leades with <hi>Delius</hi> ſo neere her, as thou of that, which ſhe makes thee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it would be no ſmall lighting to thoſe churliſh wordes, and iealous iarres, which I know ſhe paſſeth euery day with him. There is nothing faire <hi>Polydora</hi> (ſaide <hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) that giues me now any greater diſcontent, then that <hi>Diana</hi> hath reuenged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on me ſo much to her owne coſt, for louing one, who hath not any thing in him that deſerues ſuch loue, and being perforce in his companie, thou ſeeſt how much it muſt greeue her; and as for me, to ſeeke a remedie for my greefe, I woulde do it, if time and fortune would permit me.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith great content the faire Nymphes with their companie were going on their way thorow the middes of a thicke wood, and now the ſunne being readie to ſet, they entred into a faire valley, in the mids of which ran a ſwift brooke, beſet on either ſide with thicke Sallows and Sicamours; amongſt the which were many other kindes of leſſe trees, which twyning about the greater, and the golden and coloured flowers of the one,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:23115:40"/>wouen (as it were) with the greene bowes of the other, repreſented a goodly ſight and delight to the eie. The Nymphes and Shepherds tooke a pathway betweene the brooke and the faire arbours, who had not gone farre, when they came to a large greene meadow, wherein was a very faire great moate of cleere water, from whence the brooke did ſpring, that with great force ranne thorow the valley. In the middes of that moate was an Iland, wherein grew ſome greene trees, amongſt the which ſtoode a Sheepe-cote, and about the ſame a flocke of ſheepe went ſeeding of the greene and tender graſſe. The Nymphes thinking this a fit place to paſſe away the night, which was neere at hand, vpon a fine cauſey of ſtones moſt artificiallie (as it ſeemed) laide in order, they paſſed all ouer into the iland, and went directly to the cote which they ſawe before them. But <hi>Polydora</hi> going in firſt (for ſhe was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before the reſt) was ſcarce entred in when ſhe came foorth as faſt againe, and looking towards her companie, did put her ſinger vpon her mouth, in token that they ſhould come ſoftly on &amp; without any noiſe, which the Nymphes &amp; the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes perceiuing, with the leaſt they could, came into the cote, and looking into it, eſpied a bed in a corner, not made of any other thing, then of the greene bowes of thoſe Sicamours, that were growing about it, and of the greene graſſe, that did growe about the water brinkes. Vpon the which they ſawe a Shepherdeſſe lying a ſleepe, whoſe beautie ſtroke them with no leſſe admiration, then if on a ſudden they had ſeene faire <hi>Diana</hi> before their eies. She had on a light skie coloured petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coate, and vnder that a gorget of ſo paſſing fine net-worke, that they might at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure behold the delicate proportion of her ſnow white breſt, and comely feature of her euen body, for the vpper part (being of the ſame colour with the reſt) hung ſo looſe about her, that they might take a perfect view of her fine and daintie waſte. Her yellowe haire in brightnes ſurpaſſing the ſunnie beames, were looſe and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe without any order. But neuer did frizeling and adorned periwigge of any Lady in ſtately court beautifie in ſuch ſort, as the careleſſe diſorder that theſe had; and her white legge, being bare by the negligence of her harmeleſſe ſleepe, laie ſeemely out of her petticoate, but not ſo much, that the lookers on might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any part, but what with modeſtie they might well beholde. And by manie teares that (ſleeping yet) went trickling downe her faire and roſie cheekes, her ſleepe (it ſeemed) ſhould not hinder her ſorrowfull imaginations. The Nymphes and Shepherds were ſo amazed at her beautie, and at her inward ſorrow, which by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſignes they well coniectured did trouble her waking ſoule, that they knew not what to ſaie, but were forced to ſhed teares for pittie of thoſe, which they ſawe the Shepherdeſſe powre foorth: who (as with pittie and admiration they were looking on her) turned her on the other ſide, and with a greeuous ſigh fetch't from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of her hart, ſaide thus to her ſelfe. How vnfortunate art thou <hi>Beliſa,</hi> that thy greefe conſiſteth in no other thing, but in that thy life is of ſo ſmall value, that it is not able to pay thoſe things with extinction thereof, which by thine owne occaſion are deſtroyed and loſt? And then with a ſudden ſurſault ſhe awaked in ſuch ſort, that the end of her daies (it ſeemed) was neere at hand: But when ſhe ſawe the three Nymphes, and two ſuch faire Shepherdeſſes with two Shepherds, ſhe was ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that it was a good while before ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, who at laſt lifting vp her eies to looke on them againe, without ſtopping her teares, which continually ſhe powred out, or putting ſilence to her burning ſighes, which her afflicted hart ſent foorth, began to ſpeake in this ſort. Howe great a comfort to ſo comfortles a ſonle as mine is ſhould it be, if I were aſſured, that none by worde nor deede woulde
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23115:41"/>endeuour to giue me any at all; bicauſe the great reſon, that I haue (faire Nymphes) to liue enwrapped in ſuch ſadnes as I doe, hath put ſuch a kinde of emnitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene me and the conſolation of my greefe, that if I thought at any time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy it, I would my ſelfe be the authour of mine owne death: Whereat maruell not faire Nymphes, or that I woulde ſeeke to preuent me of this remedie, ſince there is no other, that can greeue me more, then this your ſudden ſight and comming to this vncouth cote, a place ſelected out and fit for no other thing, but to bewaile re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſſe greefes. Wherefore let it be a warning to thoſe that are attending their torments, to go quickly out of this place, bicauſe the misfortunes of loue haue ſtopped vp the waies in ſuch ſort, that they neuer let any hope of comfort or reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die enter in. But what hap hath ledde ſuch a faire companie to this place, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is that yeelds content. What is it (thinke you) that makes the greene graſſe of this iland growe, and the waters (that encompaſſe it rounde about) to encreaſe, but my ceaſles teares? What is it, that moues the trees of this faire valley, but the voice of my piteous outcries, and the violent breath of my ſorrowfull ſighes, which, filling the aire, do execute that office for it, which for it ſelfe it cannot do? Why do the pretie birdes ſing among theſe ſpringes, when golden Phoebus is in all his force, but to helpe to lament and bewaile my miſhaps? Wherefore is it that the timerous wilde beaſtes come foorth to the greene meadowe, but to heare my continuall plaints? I pray God your fortune hath not brought you (faire Nymphes) to this place to that end, that mine hath, bicauſe nature (according to the ſorrowfull life, that I doe paſſe in it) hath for no other thing (it ſeemes) framed it, but for thoſe that are troubled with the incurable malladies of loue, therein to paſſe away their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull liues: If any of you therefore be in this extremitie, let her paſſe on no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if not, let her go quickly from hence againe, leaſt by ſtaying heere long, ſhe be forced by the nature and qualitie of the place. The faire Shepherdeſſe ſpake theſe words with ſo many teares, that there was not any amongſt them, that coulde ſtaie theirs. They were all amazed to ſee the ſpirit, geſture and countenance wherewith ſhe ſpake them, for they came (as it appeered) from the verie center of her painfull ſoule. And ſhe coulde do no leſſe then this, becauſe the ſorrowfull ſucceſſe of her loue did take away all manner of ſuſpicion, that that greefe, which ſo extremely ſhe ſhewed, was either counterfaite or fained. But faire <hi>Doria</hi> ſpake thus vnto her. What is the cauſe (faire Shepherdeſſe) that hath driuen thy beautie to theſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities? What greefe ſo ſtrange coulde loue make an occaſion of ſo manie teares, accompanied with ſo ſole and ſolitarie a life, as thou doſt leade in this place? But what do I aske, when ſeeing thee to complaine of loue, thou telleſt me more then I am able to aske thee. It was thy deſire, when we came hether, to be aſſured that none of vs would offer thee any comfort, wherein I cannot blame thee, ſince it is the propertie of ſorrowfull ſoules not onely to abhorre comfort, but to flie from them, by whom they thinke by any meanes to receiue it. If I ſhould tell thee (faire Shepherdeſſe) that I could helpe thy greefe, what doth it auaile, if the ſame will not giue thee leaue to beleeue me? To tell thee, that in thine owne iudgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion thou doſt help thy ſelfe, I know thou haſt it not ſo free, that thou canſt do it: Of one thing yet (good Shepherdeſſe) thou maiſt be aſſured, that there is no meanes in the whole world to rid thee from this painfull life, which I would not giue then, if it lay in my power. And if this good will deſerueth any thing at all, I beſeech thee for their ſakes (that are heete preſent) and for mine owne, to tell vs the cauſe of thy greefe, becauſe there are ſome in this companie, that haue as great neede of <pb n="73" facs="tcp:23115:41"/>remedie, and whom loue hath driuen to ſo narrow a ſtreight, that, if Fortune do not ſuccour them the ſooner, I knowe not what will become of their liues. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, hearing <hi>Doria</hi> ſpeake theſe wordes, came out of her melancholie cell, and taking her by the hand, carried her vnto a fountaine in a little greene meadowe not farre off. Whither the Nymphes and Shepherdes went after them, and about the ſame ſat them downe altogither, when golden
<hi>Phoebus</hi> had made an end of his diurnall courſe, and ſiluer
<hi>Diana</hi> began hers with ſuch brightnes, as if it had beene midday. Where being in ſuch ſort as you haue heard, the faire Shepherdeſſe began to tell this which followeth.</p>
               <p>AT that time (faire Nymphes of the chaſte Goddeſſe) when I was free from loue, I heard once a certaine thing, the experience whereof did afterwardes beguile me, finding it cleane contrarie to that which I heard reported. For it was tolde me, that there was no kind of greefe, but (by telling it) was ſome lighting &amp; eaſe to her that did ſuffer it. I finde, that there is not any thing, that more augments my miſhap, then to call it to memorie, and tell it her, that is free from the like. For if I thought otherwiſe, I durſt not (beleeue me) recount vnto you the hiſtorie of my annoies. But becauſe it is true, that the telling of it to you ſhall be no cauſe of comfort to my balefull ſoule (which are the two cauſes moſt abhorred of me,) giue eare, and you ſhall heare the moſt ſtrange and haples accidents, that euer fell in loue.</p>
               <p>Not farre from this valley towards that part, where the ſunne doth ſet, there is a village in the middes of a forreſt neere to two riuers, which with their currants do water and giue life to the greene trees, whoſe ſhadowed bowes are ſo delightfull, and thicke togither, that one houſe may hardly be diſcerned from another. Euerie one of them hath their limits rounde about them, where the gardens in ſommer time are decked with fragrant flowers, beſides the abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of pleaſant orchards, which are there naturally brought foorth, though helped by the induſtrie of them, which in great Spaine are called (Freemen) by reaſon of the antiquity of their houſes &amp; linage. In this place was the vnfortunate <hi>Beliſa</hi> borne, for this name I tooke from the funt, where I would to God I had left and loſt my life. Heere liued alſo a certaine Shepherd, one of the chiefeſt for birth and riches, that was in all that countrey, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Arſenius,</hi> and married to the faireſt Shepherdeſſe in all her time, but vntimely death (becauſe her deſtinies woulde haue it ſo, or elſe for auoyding ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience that her beautie might haue cauſed) did within a fewe yeeres after ſhe was married, cut aſunder her vital thred. The greefe that <hi>Arſenius</hi> felt for the death of his beloued <hi>Florida,</hi> was ſo extreme, that he was almoſt in danger of looſing his life: the which yet he preſerued by the comfort of a ſonne ſhe left behinde her cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Arſileus,</hi> whoſe beautie and comely feature ſo farre excelled others, that they matched the gifts ſo highly commended (and deſcended to him) from <hi>Florida</hi> his mother. And yet did <hi>Arſenius</hi> for the loſſe of her, leade the moſt ſorrowfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate life, that might be. But ſeeing his Sonne in ſufficient yeeres to ſet him to ſome vertuous exerciſe, knowing, <hi>That idlenes in boyes was the curſe of vices, and an enimie to vertue,</hi> he determined to ſende him to the famous Academie of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> with intent to haue him learne thoſe ſciences, which make men mount vppe to higher degrees then men, and ſo ſent him thither indeede. But fifteene yeeres being nowe paſt ſince the death of his mother, it fell out that I going on a daie with others of our neighbours daughters to the market, kept in a prettie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:23115:42"/>towne not farre from ours, vnfortunate <hi>Arſenius</hi> (to his owne harme, and (alas) to mine, and to the preiudice of his hapleſſe ſonne) by chance eſpied me. This ſight kindled an extreme kinde of loue in him, as it appeered afterwardes by the ſtrange effects he ſhewed: for he endeuoured to make me know it ſometimes in the fielde, as I was going to carrie the Shepherds their dinner; ſometimes againe, as I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riuer to rince my clothes; and ſomtimes for water to the fountaine, where he neuer miſſed, of purpoſe to meete me. But I, (that was till then but a nouice in matters of loue, although by heare-ſaie I vnderſtoode ſome of his diſordinate ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects) ſometimes diſſembled the matter, as though I vnderſtoode not his meaning, and ſometimes made but a mocke of them, and was angry to ſee him ſo importunate and earneſt. But my wordes were not able to defende my ſelfe from his continuall ſuites, nor the great loue he bare me, ſuffered him to leaue of to woe me more and more: And in this ſort I paſſed away more then fower yeeres, in which ſpace he left not of his fond attempt, nor I to reſolue with my ſelfe to giue him the leſt fauour in the worlde. About this time came his hapleſſe ſonne
<hi>Arſileus</hi> from his ſtudie, who amongſt other ſciences, that he had ſtudied, was ſo brauely ſeene in Poetrie and Muſicke, that he excelled all others in his time. His father tooke ſuch excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioy in him, that he could neuer be out of his ſight, and not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, bicauſe <hi>Arſileus</hi> was ſuch an one indeed that he deſerued to be beloued, not onely of his father whom nature conſtrained to loue as his ſonne, but of euery one elſe in the worlde: And ſo in our towne he was ſo much eſteemed and regarded of the cheefeſt and vulgar ſort, that they talked amongſt themſelues of no other thing, then of the great wiſedome, graces, gentilitie, and many other good parts more, which beautified the flouriſhing prime of his youth. <hi>Arſenius</hi> was ſo ſecret to his ſonne, that by no meanes he would let him vnderſtand any thing touching his loue, whom although <hi>Arſileus</hi> had ſeene on a day very ſad, yet he durſt not aske him the cauſe of his heauines, but rather thought, thoſe paſſions to be the reliques of that ſorrow, which yet for the vntimely death of his faire mother, remained in his fathers breſt. But <hi>Arſenius</hi> greatly deſiring to ſende me a letter, and to get it in ſuch ſort from his ſonne, (for he knewe him to be an excellent Poet) that he might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for whom it was, he thought it moſt fit to diſcouer the matter, and the ſumme of his loue to a great friend of his called <hi>Argaſtus,</hi> a townſ-man and our neighbour, praying him earneſtly to requeſt his ſonne <hi>Arſileus</hi> (as a thing that he ſtood greatly in neede of) to pen him a letter, and to tell him, that it was to be ſent a good wale thence to a bonnie Shepherdeſſe, whom he loued and ſerued. And ſo he gaue him inſtructions of other things, making moſt for his purpoſe, that he was to requeſt him to put in the letter.
<hi>Argastus</hi> was ſo carefull about his friends buſines, that
<hi>Arſileus</hi> (vrged thereunto by his inceſſant requeſts) deliuered him the letter in as ample ſort as he requeſted it. Which
<hi>Arſenius</hi> ſeeing ſo fit for his purpoſe, wrought the meanes, that it came to my hands: the which receiuing much againſt my will, I founde that it ſaide thus.</p>

               <p>With the greateſt ſignes of dolour and of a moſt afflicted hart indeede, the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Beliſa</hi> rehearſed
<hi>Arſenius</hi> his letter, or (to ſay more truely) the letter of his ſonne <hi>Arſileus,</hi> ſtaying betweene many verſes, and repeating ſome of them twiſe, and at other ſome lifting vp her eies to heauen with ſuch anguiſh and greefe of minde, that one woulde haue thought her hart would haue burſt in <pb n="77" facs="tcp:23115:43"/>peeces. But proſecuting the ſorrowfull hiſtorie of her loue, ſhe ſaid vnto them.</p>
               <p>This letter (faire Nymphes) was the beginning of all the harme of the woefull man, that made it, and the end of all the reſt and content of the hapleſſe woman, to whom he wrote it. For when I had read it, by ſome curious inueſtigation that my ſurmiſe found out, I perceiued, that it ſauoured more of his ſonne his quicke wit, then of the father his blunt affection. And bicauſe the time was now at hand, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in loue came to take an account of the ſmall care, I had till then of his inuincible power, or bicauſe in the end I ſhould haue ſome feeling of his poyſoned ſweete, I perceiued my ſelfe a little more mollified then before, and not ſo little, but that I gaue loue place to take poſſeſſion of my libertie. And that which this tyrant did by me, was the ſtrangeſt thing that euer hapned in matters of loue, for he made me not onely loue <hi>Arſileus,</hi> but alſo his father <hi>Arſenius.</hi> Truth it is, that I loued the father to requite the loue he bare me; and the ſonne, to yeeld vp my entyre libertie into his hands, as from that hower I did indeed giue it him. So that I loued the one, not to ſeeme vngratefull; and the other, becauſe it was not in my power to do any leſſe. But when <hi>Arſenius</hi> perceiued me to be more gentle then before (which thing he deſired ſo long ſince) there was not any thing in the world, which he woulde not haue done for my content and pleaſure: For ſo many were the preſents, the iewels, and manie other gifts he ſent me, that it greeued me a little to ſee my ſelfe ſo greatly indebted to him. With euery thing he ſent me, came ſo many amorous verſes and letters, that I was forced to anſwer them againe, whereby I ſhewed him no ſignes of loue to put him in any hope, nor my ſelfe ſo coie as I was woont to be. But the loue I bare to <hi>Arſileus</hi> tooke euery day deeper roote in my hart, and moleſted my ſences in ſuch ſort, that it left no quiet place in all my ſoule. It fell out afterwards, that
<hi>Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Arſileus</hi> being in companie on a ſommers night with certain of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and ſitting vnder a faire great Oke, that ſtoode in a broade place before our houſe, <hi>Arſenius</hi> began to commend the skill which his ſonne <hi>Arſileus</hi> had in muſick and muſicall inſtruments, to giue them occaſion that were preſent, to praie him to go fetch a harpe from home, and to plaie and ſing there among them, who ſat ſo neere to our houſe, that I could not chooſe, but heare the muſicke. And as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it, ſo it fell out anſwerable to his deſire: For <hi>Arſileus,</hi> being earneſtly requeſted by the companie, ſent for a harpe, and ſweetely thereon began to plaie and ſinge. When I heard <hi>Arſileus,</hi> and with what daintie melodie he plaied, and enticing grace he ſung, I was gone almoſt as farre as might be in Cupids affects, ſeeing his father would needes beſtowe the muſicke on me, and vnwittingly enamour me of the excellent graces of his woorthie ſonne. Wherefore I ſaide to my ſelfe. Thou doſt no leſſe deceiue thy ſelfe
<hi>Arſenius</hi> by procuring thy ſonne to ſing, that I might heare him, then by ſending me a letter of his owne hande. If thou didſt but knowe what will enſue thereof, thou mighteſt well from this day admoniſh all louers, not to procure their Miſtreſſes loue by other mens gifts &amp; graces, bicauſe it commonly fals out that women do ſooner fall in loue with thoſe that are the inſtruments and meanes, then with thoſe that thinke to benefite themſelues by them. But nowe by this time did my
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> with a ſingular ſweete grace and voice, begin to ſing this Sonnet to the tune of his ſiluer ſounding Harpe.</p>

               <p>It was not onely this, which <hi>Arſileus</hi> ſung that night to the ſounde of his Harpe, but as <hi>Orpheus,</hi> when he demaunded his Nymph <hi>Euridice,</hi> made the helliſh furies gentle with his ſweete ſong, ſuſpending for a while the paines of the damned ghoſtes; ſo did vnfortunate <hi>Arſileus</hi> not onely amaze and mollifie their harts that were preſent, but wretched <hi>Beliſaes</hi> alſo, who with great boldnes from a high garret windowe was harkening vnto him: whoſe ſweete muſicke delighted moreouer the heauen, the ſtarres, and the cleere moone, which was then in her force and vigour, that in what part ſoeuer I did then caſt mine eies, it admoniſhed me (me thought) and tolde me, that I loued him more then mine owne life: whereof it was needleſſe for any to put me in minde, for if I had then beene Lady of all the worlde, I had thought my ſelfe too meane to be woorthie of him. And from thence I purpoſed to hide this affection as little from him as I could. All that night I laie imagining, by what meanes I might beſt diſcouer vnto him my griefe, but in ſuch ſort, that my vertuous name and modeſtie might not ſuffer any blemiſh, though death (when this was wanting) with her appalled feare and danger ſhould not haue hindred mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And yet when that ſhould come, and when we haue the greateſt care to auoid the occaſions that might hinder it, euen then &amp; moſt of all they preſent themſelues. The next day after needs I muſt go with other countrey maides (my kineſwomen &amp; neighbours) to a thicke wood, in the mids whereof was a cleere fountaine, whither euery other holy day we caried our kine, as well for that there was good paſture for them, as alſo for that (the freſh &amp; hungry euening being come) we might take the milke of the next day, whereof we made ſweete butter, &amp; freſh cheefe and creame. But I and my companie being ſet round about the fountaine, and our kine liyng in the coole ſhades of the thick and branchie trees of that hedge, licking their yong and tender caluelings, that lay by them, one of my friendes amongſt the reſt, (vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted (it ſeemed) with that loue that warred within my ſoule) with many requeſts importuned me (vpon paine neuer to receiue any pleaſure at her handes) to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the time and that companie with ſome ſong or other. My many excuſes (with telling her beſides that times and occaſions were not alwaies one, nor alike) auailed me very little from performing that, which with ſo great inſtance ſhe requeſted of me: And therefore to the ſound of a Bagpipe, whereon one of them moſt ſweetely plaied, I began to ſing theſe verſes.</p>

               <p>Theſe verſes of the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Beliſa</hi> pleaſed the Nymphes and Shepherdes, no leſſe then the ſweete and ſorrowfull note, wherewith ſhe ſung them, who (proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the hiſtorie of her miſhap) ſaid: But <hi>Arſileus</hi> was not farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, when I ſung theſe verſes, for hauing gone foorth that day a hunting, &amp; being in the thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of the woode to paſſe away the heate of the day, it ſeemed he heard vs, and as one, that loued muſicke well, came ſoftly pacing amongſt the thickeſt trees that were neere vnto the fountaine, bicauſe he might from thence the better heare vs. But our muſicke being ended, he came ſtraight to the fountaine, whoſe ſudden ſight engendred a forcible paſſion of ioy and feare in my amazed ſoule. Which was no great maruell, bicauſe an enamoured hart may be as well ſurſaulted with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ioy, as with an vnexpected ſorrow. He came to vs where we were ſet, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſaluting vs, in very good ſort, and with a good grace requeſted pardon of vs; That certes (faire Nympes) when I begin to thinke of the ſweete behauiour, and ripened wiſedome of vnfortunate <hi>Arſileus,</hi> I do not thinke that his ſiniſter fates and fortune were the cauſe, that death tooke him away ſo quickly from my ſight, but rather that the worlde was not woorthie to enioye any longer ſo ſingular a youth, on whom nature had beſtowed ſo many perfections of beautie and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with ſo many gifts of the minde, as that hee left not his like behinde him. After hee had ſaluted vs, and leaue obtained (which hee humblie requeſted of vs) to paſſe away the heate of the daye in our companie, hee caſt his eies vpon me (which had hee neuer done, happie had we both beene) and was (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered afterwardes by diuers ſignes, whereby hee manifeſted his affection to me) extremely ouercome in my loue. Vnhappie I, (that needed not to looke on him to loue him, being ſo much enwrapped in his, by ſeeing him before, as hee was nowe in mine after hee had ſeene me) lifted vp mine eies to beholde him at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <pb n="82" facs="tcp:23115:46"/>inſtant when he addreſſed his to looke on me, which forcible encounter both of vs would willingly had not befell, bicauſe that modeſtie and ſhame ſharpely rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked me, and feare left not him without bitter puniſhment. But he to diſſemble his newe greefe, began to diſcourſe with me in matters cleane different from thoſe, which he woulde haue imparted to me, to ſome of which I anſwered againe, my thoughts and ſences being then more careful to ſee, if by the alteration of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, or mildenes in his words he ſhewed any ſignes of loue, then fully to ſatisfie his queſtions. For then ſo greatly I deſired to heare him ſighe, (to confirme me in my doubtfull hope) that in lieu of ſuch a happines I woulde not haue cared to haue paſſed any greefe whatſoeuer. And in the end I coulde not wiſh for more apparant ſignes of loue in him, then at that preſent I behelde: for what with his toong he coulde not, with his eies he manifeſtly declared vnto me the amorous and ſecret paſſions of his hart. And being in theſe points, the two Shepherdeſſes, that were with me, roſe vp to milke their kine, whom I praied to take the paines to milke mine likewiſe, for that I felt my ſelfe not well at eaſe. And needleſſe it was for me to entreate them much, and for <hi>Arſileus</hi> to haue any fitter occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto me his greefe, wherein I knowe not if he was deceiued, by imagining the occaſion why I would be without companie, but am aſſured, that he was not a little glad to helpe himſelfe by the opportunitie thereof. The Shepherdeſſes were buſie about milking their kine, which ſuffered themſelues to be deceiued with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane induſtry by tying their gentle cauelings to their feete. That <hi>Arſileus</hi> now (new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupriſed in loue) had yeelded himſelfe ſo much to Cupids bonds, that nothing but ſpeedie death could giue him libertie, I perceiued apparantly, in that fower or fiue times he began to ſpeake vnto me, and euery time in vaine: for the feare he had of my diſpleaſure came euer betweene him and his ſpeech, and therefore I began to talke to him of another matter, not farre from his intent, bicauſe he might not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe much from it, inducing him thereby to tell me what it was that ſo often he went about to ſpeake and could not vtter, ſaying. Doth this countrey like thee well, <hi>Arſileus?</hi> For the entertainment and conuerſation of that, where thou haſt lately ſpent thy time, is, I knowe, farre different from ours, which therefore cannot ſo well content thee as that. As of my ſelfe (quoth he) I haue not ſo much power, ſo hath not my vnderſtanding (faire Shepherdeſſe) ſo much libertie, to anſwer this demand. And changing this manner of talke (to ſhewe him the way with occaſion) I ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againe: I haue heard ſay, that in thoſe parts are many faire Shepherdeſſes, that paragonned to vs, they ſo farre excell vs, that we muſt ſeeme but meane in thy ſight that are heere. I might be thought too ſimple (ſaide <hi>Arſileus</hi>) if I woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this, for though there are as faire there (as you haue heard) yet heere are they which with mine owne eies I daily ſee, that ſo farre ſurmount them, as the ſun doth the chiefeſt ſtars in brightnes. This is the greateſt gloſe in the world (ſaid I againe) and yet for all this I am not ſorrie, that our countrey-women are ſo farre in your good opinion and liking, becauſe I am one of them my ſelfe. Which onely reaſon (ſaide he) if there were no other, were ſufficient enough to prooue what I haue ſaid. So that by word and worde he came to tell me that, which I deſired to heare, though I would not then make him knowe ſo much, but rather intreated him to ſtop vp the paſſage of his wordes. But fearing leaſt this might haue bene an occaſion to qualifie his loue (as often times it falleth out, that diſgraces and disfauours in the beginning are the meanes to make any leaue of their true commenced loue) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tune againe my iarring anſwere, ſaying thus vnto him. And if thy loue be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23115:46"/>ſuch <hi>Arſileus,</hi> that it will not ſuffer thee to leaue of to loue me, be ſecret therein, ſince it is the manner of thoſe that are wiſe and iudicious (like thy ſelfe) to be no leſſe in things of meaner conſequence. Albeit by all this, which I haue ſaide vnto thee, I would not haue thee thinke to profit thy ſelfe any more, then that I muſt for euer liue bounde vnto thee, if thou wilt follow my counſell in this behalfe. This did my toong ſpeake, but an other thing did my pitifull eies affirme, with the which I ſtill looked him in the face, and caſting out a ſigh (an aſſured meſſenger of my inwarde and ſenſible paſſion) which <hi>Arſileus</hi> might haue perceiued well ynough (if Loue at the leaſt would haue giuen him leaue) I held my peace. In this ſort we departed from one another, and many times afterwards he talked with me of theſe matters, who ſent me beſides many letters, and fine Sonnets of his owne making. And as he ſung them night by night to the tune of his ſweete Harpe, with amorous teares I often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times harkened vnto him, ſo that in the ende both of vs was aſſured of each others loue. But now did
<hi>Arſenius</hi> his father importune me in ſuch ſort, with his meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and preſents, that I knew not what way to take, to defend me from him. And it was the ſtrangeſt thing in the world to ſee, how the loue, which increaſed euery day in the ſonne, was alſo augmented in the father, though they were both of different age and powers: and yet the ſame (I muſt needes confeſſe) made me not reiect him, nor refuſe any thing, that he ſent me. But liuing now in all contentment, and ſeeing my ſelfe ſo truly beloued of <hi>Arſileus,</hi> whom I loued ſo deerely againe, it ſeemed that fortune would make an end of all my ioy with the moſt hapleſſe euent that was euer ſeene before. For thus it was, that
<hi>Arſileus</hi> and I appointing to meete together on a certaine night (too darke and diſmall for me; bicauſe I neuer ſince knew perfectly what day meant) we concluded that he ſhould come into my fathers orchard, and I to my chamber windowe, which opened right vpon a Mulberie tree, whereon he might eaſily get vp to be necre vnto me, there to talke togither of our matters. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed <hi>Beliſa</hi> that ſhalt neuer conceiue to what purpoſe I brought him to ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when as euery day, ſometimes in the fielde, ſometimes at the riuer ſide, and ſometimes at the wood, when I carried my kine to paſture, and ſometimes when I driue my ſheepe to the folde, he might at pleaſure haue talked with me, as he did many daies before. But my hard hap was the cauſe, that fortune would be paied for the content, which ſhe had lent me till then, with making me liue all my life time without it. For now the appointed hower, (which was the ende of his daies, and the beginning of my woes) being come, <hi>Arſileus</hi> came iuſt at the time, and to the very place, where both of vs talking together of thoſe things, which they may imagine, that haue ſometimes loued well, his wretched father
<hi>Arſenius,</hi> that accuſtomed many nights to walke vp and downe about our houſe, to ſee if he could ſee me (which if I had ſo well remembred, for it was ſo far out of my thoughtes, as if I had neuer knowen any ſuch matter, I would neuer haue conſented to put him in ſuch danger) in the ende happened to come thither that night, and iuſt at that hower when his ſonne was in the tree, and ſo priuily, that though he had quickly eſpied vs, we could neither heare, nor ſee him. And knowing it was I, that was ſpeaking out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but not his ſonne, that was in the Mulberie tree, not imagining who he might be, it was the principall cauſe of our ill ſucceſſe. For thereupon he conceiued ſuch great wroth and iealouſie, that, without any noiſe at all, he bied him home, where bending a Croſſebowe, and putting a poiſoned arrow in it, came againe to the place where we were, and aimed ſo right at his ſonne, that the arrow pearcing his tender hart, he fell immediately downe dead from the tree, ſaying. How little time (my <pb n="84" facs="tcp:23115:47"/>deere <hi>Beliſa</hi>) doth fortune lend me to ſerue thee according to my great good will &amp; deſire. Which wordes he could ſcarce vtter, when the accurſed father, who by his ſpeech knew that he was the homicide of his owne ſonne, with a deſperate outcrie ſaide. Thriſe wretched and accurſed may I euer be, if thou art my ſonne
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> who ſeemeſt to be no other by thy voice. Whereupon comming vnto him, and by the light of the moone, that ſhone vpon his face, knowing him well, and that he had giuen vp the ghoſt, he ſaide. Since (cruell <hi>Beliſa</hi>) my vnfortunate ſonne by thy means hath bene ſlaine, it is not meete that the murdering father ſuruiue to lament his vntimely death. At which wordes taking out his Woodknife, he thruſt it into his hart, and fell downe preſently dead! O vnhappie chaunce! O ſtrange caſe, neuer heard of, nor ſeene before! O greeuous ſcandale to their eares that ſhall he are the lamentable diſcourſe of my balefull tragedie? O miſerable <hi>Beliſa,</hi> may thy guiltie hart thinke of theſe things, and not take that way, which both father and ſonne haue taken for thy ſake? Alas it ſhall be great impietie not to mingle thy blood with theirs, who deſired ſo much to ſerue thee. But when wretched ſoule I ſawe this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie accident, without any more adoe, I left my fathers houſe, and went vp and downe, wearying the heauens with importunate complaints, and burning the aire with ſmokie ſighes, vntill I came to this place, where accuſing cruell fortune and hatefull death, that had in ſo ſhort time taught me to feele the woundes of their cruell dartes. I haue liued ſixe monethes, without ſeeing or ſpeaking to any perſon, and not deſirous of any companie or conſolation whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Faire <hi>Beliſa</hi> hauing made an end of her pitifull tale, began to weepe ſo bitterly, that euery one there was forced with their teares to helpe to bewaile her dire miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. And adding further ſhe ſaide. This is faire Nymphes, the ſorrowfull hiſtorie (or rather dolefull tragedie) of my hapleſſe loues, and of their bloodie ſucceſſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then if this be ſuch an ill, that fortune or time may cure and remedie? O <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi> how often did I feare it, without thinking of that, which I iuſtly feared. But ſhe that will not beleeue her feare and preuent it, let her not maruell, when ſhe ſees that come to paſſe which ſhe feared, for well I knew, thou couldſt not be any long time without meeting me, and that my ioy could endure no longer, then when
<hi>Arſenius</hi> thy father perceiued any thing of our loues. I woulde to God it had ſo fallen out, that the greateſt hurt that he could haue done me, had bene but to baniſh thee his ſight and our towne. For an ill which is cured with time, may with leſſe harme be ſuffered. O
<hi>Arſenius,</hi> the death of thy ſonne is no impediment to the greefe, that I alſo conceiue for thine, for the loue which thou didſt continually beare me, thy vertuous and pure zeale, wherewith thou didſt euer loue me, thy bountie and coſt beſtowed on me, the tempeſtuous and ill nightes, that thou haſt paſſed for my ſake, will let me doe no leſſe, then lament and bewaile thy diſaſtrous end, for by this time I had bene married vnto thee, if thy ſweete ſonne <hi>Arſileus</hi> had not come to our towne. If I ſhould ſay, that I did not loue thee well, I ſhould deceiue the world; for in the end there is no woman, if ſhe knowes ſhe is truly beloued, but will loue little or much againe, although otherwiſe ſhe manifeſt the ſame. But now my toong holde thy peace, ſince thou haſt told more then thou wert asked. And pardon me (faire Nymphes) if I haue bene tedious in my ſorrowfull narration, bicauſe ſo great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cannot be compriſed in fewe wordes. Whileſt the Shepherdeſſe was telling that which you haue heard, <hi>Syrenus, Syluanus, Seluagia,</hi> and faire <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and the three Nymphes coulde not giue eare without ſome ſecrete teares, although the Nymphes, as women neuer touched with loue, felt her paine and greefe, but not <pb n="85" facs="tcp:23115:47"/>the circumſtances of it. But faire
<hi>Doria</hi> ſeeing the comfortleſſe Shepherdeſſe did not leaue of her bitter complaint, began to comfort her in this ſort. Let thy teares ceaſe <hi>Beliſa,</hi> ſince thou ſeeſt what ſmall remedie thou haſt of them, and waigh that two eies are not able to bewaile ſo great a greefe. But what ſorrow can there be, which is not ended, or endes not her that ſuffers it: and yet I could ſhew thee the way whereby I could a little lighten thy paine. Wherefore, I pray thee goe with vs as well for this reſpect, as for that it is not meete thou ſhouldeſt waſte thy life ſo fondly, for in that place where we carrie thee, thou maiſt chooſe out what manner of life thou liſt, &amp; where none is that may hinder thee of it. This place (anſwered the Shepherdeſſe) I thought moſt fit not onely to lament my woes in, but to end my life in the ſame, the which (if time doth but intreate me as it hath done hitherto) ſhall not be very long. But now ſince this is thy will, I am minded not to gainſay it; and as for mine (faire Nymphes) from this time forward you may vſe it according to your owne pleaſures. They were all glad that ſhe yeelded to goe with them. And bicauſe the night was paſſed on more then three howers, and the moone did ſhine as cleere as day, they ſupped there with that prouiſion the Shepherdes had in their ſcrips. And after they had ſupped, euery one choſe out her place that did beſt content her, to paſſe the reſt of the night away, the which the louers ſpent more in teares and ſighes then in ſleepe; and the reſt that were free, eaſed themſelues of their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe they had the day before.</p>

Both the Shepherds acquainted her with their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed paines, and the Shepherdeſſes tolde her the ſorrowfull ſumme of their loues, to trie if by theſe meanes they might mitigate her paine a little. But all comfort is in vaine where the greefe is remedileſſe. The diſguiſed Ladie tooke ſuch delight in
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſaes</hi> beautie, diſcretion, and ſweete graces, that ſhe coulde not ſatisfie her-ſelfe by asking her ſtill more queſtions, though <hi>Beliſa</hi> was almoſt wearie with anſwering to them. And the familiaritie betweene them both was ſo great, that it made the Shepherds and the Shepherdeſſe in a manner emulate their conuerſation. But they came to a thicke woode full of wilde ſhadowed trees, where they coulde not chuſe, (had they not beene guided by the Nymphes) but haue loſt themſelues. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore led the way before thorow a narrow glade, where they could not enter in but by one and one. And hauing gone halfe a league thorow the thickeſt thereof, they came into a broade and faire plaine lying betweene two goodly riuers, both which <pb n="86" facs="tcp:23115:48"/>were brinked on either ſide with greene &amp; tall trees. In the middes thereof ſuddenly appeered vnto their ſight a ſtately Pallace, with ſo high and loftie turrets, that it filled them full of woonder and delight to behold it. Before they came to this great pallace, they ſawe diuers Nymphes of incomparable beautie comming foorth to meete them: All of them apparelled with daintie white vailes, curiouſly wouen with fine threeds of golde and ſiluer, wearing garlands of redolent flowers vpon their yellow haire, which in moſt comely grace was hanging downe looſe vpon their ſhoulders. After them came a Lady, which ſeemed (by the grauitie and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of her perſon) to be a woman of ſome great ſtate and authoritie, attyred in blacke veluet, and leaning (as ſhe came) vpon one of her Nymphes ſhoulders, the faireſt in the companie. When the three Nymphes were come vnto them, with great ioy and many imbracings they were receiued of the other. But when the Lady came nigh, with great reuerence they kiſſed her handes, whom ſhe entertained and wel-commed as ioyfully as they could wiſh. And before the Nymphes ſpake one worde of that which had paſſed, ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> (for ſo was this honorable Ladie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) ſaide to
<hi>Feliſmena.</hi> The great aduenture which thou haſt done for theſe three Nymphes, cannot (faire Shepherdeſſe) be requited with leſſe, then by euer hauing me bound vnto thee; and to do thee all the fauour I may, which ſhal not be ſmal, thy neede being ſo great: For ſince I knowe what thou art (without report of anie) and whether thy thoughts do leade thee, thou ſhalt in the ende perceiue if I be able to helpe thee in any thing. Wherefore be of good cheere, for if I liue, thou ſhalt ſee and enioy thy deſire, in purſuite whereof though thou haſt paſſed much paine and trauell, there is nothing (as thou knoweſt) obtained nor gotten without it. Faire
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> maruelling much at <hi>Felicias</hi> wordes, and forgetting not to giue her due thankes for ſo great curteſies and promiſes, anſwered thus. Since you deigne (ſage Ladie) not onely in the end to remedie my griefes, but to bleſſe the remnant of my life with happines and content, whereas there is no deſert of my part that may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any ſuch fauour at your gracious hands, do but conſider (good Lady) what is due to your ſelfe, and then you ſhall ſee how I remaine acquited of this debt, and your ſelfe ſufficiently paied. For ſo great deſerts as thine are (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) and for ſuch excellent beautie, as nature hath beſtowed on thee, all that may be done, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle enough. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> then bowed herſelfe at theſe wordes to kiſſe her hands: but <hi>Felicia</hi> embraced her louingly, and looking vpon the Shepherds and Shepherdeſles, ſaide vnto them. Be not diſmaied couragious Shepherds, and diſcreete Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, at the continuance of your ſeuerall greefes, for I haue alſo no leſſe care of their ſpeedie remedies. The Shepherdes and the Shepherdeſſe kiſſed her handes, and went in all together to the ſtately Palace. Before which was a faire broade court, ſet round about with high Cypres trees, and placed in good order, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paued all ouer with Lozanges of Allablaſter and blacke Marble in manner of chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key worke. In the mids whereof ſtood a fountaine of Iaſpar Marble, ſet vpon fower great braſen Lions. And in the mids of the fountaine a Iaſpar piller, about the which fower Nymphes (moſt liuely made out of white Marble) had their places. They reached vp their armes on high, and in their handes held ſeuerall veſſels after the Antique Roman manner, out of the which from certaine Lions mouthes, that were painted in them, they powred Criſtalline water: The portall of the Palace was of poliſhed Marble, with all the baſes and chaptres of the pillers gilded, as likewiſe the garments of the imagerie that was ſet in it. All the houſe ſeemed to be made of ſhining Iaſpar, with ſtatues and figures of many Roman Emperours and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23115:48"/>matrones therein engrauen, and with other like antiquities. All the windowes were double leafed a peece, and the ſprings and bars belonging to them of bright ſiluer, and all the gates of ſtately Cedar. The houſe was quadrant, and at euery Canton was reared vp a high and artificiall tower. Comming to the portall, they ſtaied a little to behold the ſtrange workmanſhip and the imagerie that was ſo liuely grauen in it, that it ſeemed rather a naturall then artificiall worke, or wrought by humane induſtrie, wherein were two Nymphes of maſſie ſiluer that ſtood on the tops of two pillers, and helde vp betweene them a poliſhed table of ſmooth Ieat with golden letters grauen in it, that ſaide thus.</p>

They were ſerued with ſuch plentie of ſundrie daintie diſhes, as is almoſt impoſſible in order to ſet downe.

               <p>Sage <hi>Felicia</hi> and the Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> gaue attentiue eare vnto the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, that the Nymphes and Shepherdes made, and to the ſundry opinions, which on both ſides they ſhewed by ſinging. And <hi>Felicia</hi> ſmyling on <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> ſaide to her in her eare. Who beleeues not (faire Shepherdeſſe) but that moſt of theſe words haue touched thy ſoule to the quicke? who with a milde and ſober grace, anſwered <pb n="90" facs="tcp:23115:50"/>her againe. Such were the words good Lady, that whoſe ſoule they did not touch, the ſame ſhould not be touched with ſuch loue as mine is. <hi>Felicia</hi> then lifting vp her voice a little higher, ſaide vnto her. In theſe loue matters I note a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which I finde for the moſt part true, That the generous minde and delicate witte by many degrees excelleth him in affection, that hath not theſe gifts. Becauſe as loue is a vertue, and vertue doth euer chooſe her being in the beſt place, it is cleere, that perſons of valour and dignitie, are more enamoured, and (as they are properly termed) better louers, then thoſe of baſer condition and eſtate. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Shepherdeſſes hearing what <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide, ſeemed to be ſomewhat angry in their mindes, which made <hi>Syluanus</hi> to thinke, that her words ought not to eſcape without an anſwer, who therefore ſaide thus vnto her. Wherein good Ladie doth a noble minde and fine witte conſiſt? <hi>Felicia</hi> (who by and by perceiued to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Shepherd demanded this queſtion, becauſe ſhe woulde not giue him anie occaſion of diſcontent) ſaide. In no other thing but in the proper and ſole vertue of him that loues, as to haue a liuely and quicke witte, a mature and good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a thought tending to high and ſtately things, and in other vertues which doe ariſe and flow from them themſelues. I am ſatisfied ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> and ſo are theſe Shepherdeſſes, becauſe we imagined (diſcreete Lady) that you take valour and vertue to be onely in noble perſonages. I ſpeake it to this ende, bicauſe he is but poore in the giftes of nature, that goes to ſeeke them foorth in thoſe that are gone and paſt. It pleaſed not the other Shepherdeſſe a little to heare what <hi>Sylua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> had ſaide; and the Nymphes did laugh, to ſee how the Shepherds did bluſh at <hi>Felicias</hi> propoſition. Who taking
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> by the hand, brought her into a faire chamber, where ſhe lay her ſelfe all alone: And after ſhe had paſſed the time with her in many diſcourſes, ſhe put her in great hope of enjoying her deſire, &amp; the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous end of her loue, by hauing <hi>Don Felix</hi> to her husband, albeit ſhe ſaide, that this could not be done, without paſſing firſt ſome fewe trauels and troubles more: which the Lady made ſmall account of, who in countermaund of them did encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and comfort her ſelfe with the guerdon that ſhe hoped to gaine by them. <hi>Felicia</hi> tolde her moreouer, that during her abode in her pallace, ſhe ſhoulde put off her paſtorall habits, vntill the time came, when ſhe was to weare them againe. And therefore calling vnto her the three Nymphes, in whoſe companie ſhe came, ſhe commanded them to apparell her in ſuch garments, as to her noble and high eſtate were requiſite. The Nymphes were not ſlow in executing her command, nor <hi>Feliſmena</hi> diſobedient in doing that which
<hi>Felicia</hi> thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for her. They leading her therefore away by the hand, brought her into an inward cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, at the one ſide whereof was a dore, which faire <hi>Doria</hi> opening, they went downe a paire of alablaſter ſtaires into a faire hall, in the middeſt whereof was a ceſterne of moſt cleere water, where all the Nymphes did vſe to bathe themſelues. Where ſtripping themſelues naked with <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> they did bathe themſelues. And after they had adreſſed their golden haire, they went vp to one of <hi>Felicias</hi> inward chambers, where the Nymphes hauing apparelled themſelues, they did alſo put theſe garments on
<hi>Feliſmena:</hi> A faire petticoate of carnation printed ſatten, the vpper body of ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cloth of gold, of the ſame colour, and fringed beneath, and garded with a lace of beaten golde and ſmall pearle. A gowne of crymoſin veluet, with the ſleeues, the bodies and skirts beneath embrodered with knots of ſeede pearle, and golde which was curiouſly wrought with needle by artificiall and cunning hande. A kirtle of pure white ſatten full of embrodered flowers and rare works of ſiluer, in the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23115:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>middes whereof did ſticke out faire orientall pearles. And tying vp her haire with a carnation ribbon of ſilke and ſiluer, they did put thereon a caule of glittering golde, in euery corner whereof a precious Ruby was ſet, with a naturall criſped periwigge of her owne haire, matching the brighteſt golde in colour, which ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned either ſide of her criſtalline forehead: wherein were put two iewels curiouſlie enchaſed with tablet Diamonds and Saphires of infinite value. The border that bound vp her caule, was of choſen flowers of golde, enameled with ſundrie liuely colours, and beſet betweene with Emeraulds and Rubies, in the middes whereof, iuſt betweene the two periwigs, hung downe a rich iewell of ſparkeling Diamonds vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſnowe white browe, with three long orientall pearles in forme of acornes, hanging therea. The attyre of her head was in forme of two little ſhips made of Emeraulds, with all the ſhrouds and tackling of cleere Saphyres. About her white necke, they put a little chaine of fine golde, made in manner of a wreathed ſnake, with an enameled Eagle of golde in her mouth, which helde betweene both her tallons a Rubie of infinite price. When the three Nymphes did ſee her adorned in this ſort, they wondred at her excellent beautie, and then brought her into the hall, where the other Nymphes and Shepherds were. And whereas they did till then knowe her for none other then a Shepherdeſſe, they remained ſo aſtoniſhed, that they knewe not what to ſaie. <hi>Felicia</hi> commanded her Nymphes after this to carie faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> and her company to ſee the ſumptuous and rich temple, which was preſently done, the ſage Lady betaking her ſelfe to her ſolitarie chamber. <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydora</hi> therfore and <hi>Cynthia</hi> taking <hi>Feliſmena</hi> between them, &amp; the other Nymphes the Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes, who for their wiſedome, and many other good parts were not a little made of, went out into a great court, the arches and pillers whereof were of Iaſpar marble, and the baſes and chaptres of Allablaſter, with many borders and workes cut out after the Romaine manner, gilded in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces very curiouſly, and wrought all ouer with Moyſaical worke: the pillers were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Lyons, Ounces and Tygres, ſo liuely cut of braſſe, that they looked as though they would aſſaile them that came into that place. In the midſt of the court was an eight ſquare paterne or Obeliske of ſhining copper, ten cubits high, vpon the top whereof ſtoode fierce <hi>Mars</hi> armed at all points after the ancient manner, whom the Gentils called the God of battailes. In this Obeliske with maruellous art and skill were ſet foorth the proud ſquadrons of the Romaines on the one ſide, and the Carthaginian campe on the other ſide. Before the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>After they had particularly behelde the paterne, and all the knights and valiant champions placed in it, they went into a rich hall, the feeling whereof was all of yuorie, woonderfully wrought and carued, the wals of allablaſter, and many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hiſtories ſo liuely cut out and grauen in them, that one would verily haue thought, that <hi>Lucretia</hi> killed her ſelfe indeede, and ſubtill <hi>Medea</hi> vndid her webbe in the Iland of Ithaca; and that the famous Romaine Lady yeelded to the fatall ſiſter, bicauſe ſhe would not offende her honour with the ſight of the horrible mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; and that the louing wife of <hi>Mauſeolus</hi> was making great lamentation, thinking to what end the ſepulcher of her husband was counted for one of the ſeuen won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the world: And many other hiſtories and examples of chaſte Ladies worthie to be eternized with immortall fame thorow out the whole world, bicauſe it ſeemed not ſufficient ynough for ſome of them, to giue manifeſt examples by their vnſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted life, but for others, by their vntimely and cruell death great teſtimonie of their pure and vndefiled thoughts, amongſt the which the Spaniſh <hi>Coronella</hi> was one, who did rather commit her body to conſuming flames, then ſuffer her chaſte minde to be ouercome with the motion and delight of a diſhoneſt thought. After they had viewed all the figures well, and the varietie of the hiſtories round about the wals of the hall, they went into another ſquare court, which for the riches thereof, ſeemed to their iudgements ſo much to excell all that they had ſeene, as the ſubſtance doth the ſhadowe; for all the wals of it were couered ouer with fine golde, and the paue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of precious ſtones. Round about this Quadrant ſtood the figures of many Ladies of Spaine, and of other nations, and aboue them all, the Goddeſſe
<hi>Diana</hi> curiouſly cut out of mettall of Corynth, with ſhort garmentes like a hunter, adorned with much pearle and precious ſtones of great value, who had her bowe <pb n="94" facs="tcp:23115:52"/>in her hande, and her golden quiuer hanging downe by her ſide, enuironed rounde about with a troupe of Nymphes fairer then <hi>Titan</hi> in his cheefeſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Shepherdes and the Shepherdeſſes were ſo amazed at the ſight of theſe things, that they knew not what to ſay, bicauſe the riches of the houſe were ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the figures ſo liuely, the workmanſhip of the Quadrant ſo excellent, and the proportion of the Ladies that were retracted there, with ſo great art, that they thought it impoſſible to imagine a more perfect and abſolute, or a more ſumptuous building in the whole world then that was. On the one ſide of the Quadrant ſtood fower Laurell trees of gold, ſo brauely enameled with greene leaues, that in gardens there were none more freſh or liuely, and neere to them a little fountaine made all of beaten ſiluer, in the middes whereof was likewiſe a Nymph of beaten gold, which at her faire breaſtes thorow nybles of Rubies ſpouted out water cleerer then Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall: and neere to this fountaine did <hi>Orpheus</hi> the famous muſition ſit, enchaunted with the age that he was in, when his
<hi>Euridice</hi> was requeſted of importunate <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus:</hi> He had on a cote of cloth of ſiluer, interſeamed and imbrodered with flowers of ſeede pearle, his ſleeues broad about the ſhoulders, and falling very narrow to his elbowes, from whence his armes came out naked. He had on a paire of hoſe of cloth of ſiluer to the knee, and made after the olde faſhion of Thrace, wrought full of little golden Harpes and Citherens, his golden buſh of haire, which hung downe curled and long, was tied about with a faire Laurell wreath. But when he perceiued the Nymphes comming towardes him, he began moſt ſweetely to touch a fine Harpe, which he had in his handes, with the diuine melodie whereof the ſtrangers were ſo much rauiſhed, that they forgot all that they had ſeene, in reſpect of this new delight.
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> ſate her downe vpon a faire lowe bed in the Quadrant, which for the moſt was couered all ouer with purple damaske, finely wrought and fringed with golde, and the Nymphes and Shepherdeſſes about her, the Shepherdes lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon the ſiluer fountaine. In this ſort therefore they were harkening to worthy <hi>Orpheus,</hi> as if he had bin ſinging amongſt the <hi>Cyconians</hi> when <hi>Cypariſus</hi> was turned into a Cypres tree, and <hi>Atis</hi> into a Pine tree.

Who now hauing particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly viewed the rich chamber of eſtate with euery thing in it that was woorth the ſeeing (as all was) the Nymphes went foorth by a certaine dore into the great hall, and by an other out of the hall into a faire garden, the beautie whereof ſtroke no leſſe admiration into their mindes, then the ſtrange things which they had ſeene before: for amongſt the fruitfull trees, and ſweete flowers, were many ſepulchers and tombes erected of diuers Nymphes and Ladies, which with great puritie had kept their chaſtitie (due to the Goddeſſe thereof) inniolate and vnſtained. Some of the tombes were adorned with coronets of knottie Iuie; others with chapplets of ſweete Myrtles; and ſome with garlands of greene Laurell. There were alſo manie
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:23115:56"/>Allabluſter fountaines in the garden, ſome of Iaſpar marble, &amp; ſome of other mettall ſeated under vines, which with artificiall arches and wreathes aloft did ſpred foorth their branches depreſſed with cluſters of coloured grapes. The Mytrhe trees grew in manner of fower walles, with embattlements and pinnacles on the tops of them, and on the ſides aboue them were certaine Terraſſes and walkes, reared vp, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as ouer all the garden beſides) did growe many ſweete flowers of ſundry colours, as white Ieſmins, Woodbyne, and many more delightfull to the inſatiable eie. In the hiddes of the garden ſtoode a Ieat-ſtone vpon fower brazen pillers, and in the thids of it a tombe framed out of Iaſpar, which fower Nymphes that were wrought out of white Allablaſter did hold vp with their handes, and about it ſtoode manie Tapers of Virgine waxe burning in maſſie candleſtickes of bright ſiluer, that were made in artificiall manner. About this tombe ſtoode certaine Lordes and Knights, ſome faſhioned out of ſtone, and mettall, other ſom out of Iaſpar marble, and other matter. Which figures ſhewed ſuch great ſorrow by their countenances, that they filled <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> hart, and all theirs that were looking on the tombe, with no leſſe greefe, then admiration. But viewing it narrowly, they ſawe in a table of ſhining golde, which at the foote of the ſepulchre, a dead and pale mattone held betweene her hands, this Epitaphe ſubſcribed.</p>

O death, how far am I from thinking that thou maieſt comfort me with other womens harmes? The ſmall time, that the world enioyed the great beautie and wiſedome, wherewith they tell me this Nymph was endowed, doth not a little greeue me, bicauſe as ſhe was <pb n="104" facs="tcp:23115:57"/>not her-ſelfe in loue, ſo did not any deſerue, ſhe ſhould be ſo. For had ſhe beene, I would then account her for ſo happie a woman by dying, as my ſelfe vnfortunate, by ſeeing how ſmall reckoning thou makeſt of me (cruell death) ſince taking from me all my good, and the onely ioy of my life, thou doſt not leaue me heere, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to feele the neuer-ceaſing paine of this heauie want. O my
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> O rare wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in ſuch yoong yeeres? O the moſt faithfull louer that euer was, and the fineſt wit that the heauens could euer infuſe into ſo braue an ornament of nature. What eies may without inundations of reares behold thy ſorrowfull abſence? And what hard hart ſuffer thy vntimely and difaſtrous end? O <hi>Arſenius, Arſenius,</hi> how ſmal a time wert thou vnable to endure the violent death of thy vnfortunate ſonne, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing more occaſion to ſuffer it, then my ſelfe? Why didſt thou make me (cruell <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenius</hi>) participate of two deathes? Of both which to preuent the leaſt that did greeue me, I would haue giuen a thouſand liues. Farewell (happie Nymphe) the light and honour of the royall houſe of Aragon: God giue thy ſoule eternall glory, and deliuer mine from ſo many woes and afflictions, wherinto it is ſo deepely ſunke. After that <hi>Beliſa</hi> had ſpoken theſe wordes, and after they had ſeene many tombes more, very richly erected, they went out by a backe dore in the garden, into a greene meadowe, where they found the ſage Ladie
<hi>Felicia</hi> recreating her-ſelfe alone, and walking vp and downe, who ſeeing them comming towards her, receiued them all with a ioyfull countenance. And whileſt it was time to go to ſupper, they went to a pleaſant walke in a groue of Sicamours harde by, where the Nymphes of the ſumptuous temple were woont many times to go and diſport themſelues: where ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe in a little plat of greene graſſe, that was encompaſſed round about with leauie Sicamours, they began to diſcourſe one with another of that, which did beſt pleaſe their fancies. The Lady
<hi>Felicia</hi> called the Shepheard <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> to her. The Nymph <hi>Doria</hi> ſat her downe with
<hi>Syluanus</hi> in one place of the greene meadowe, and the Shepherdeſſes
<hi>Seluagia</hi> and <hi>Beliſa</hi> went by themſelues, with the moſt beautifull Nymphes <hi>Cynthia</hi> and <hi>Polydora</hi> into another, ſo that (though they were not farre aſunder) yet they might talke togither well enough, and not trouble one another. But <hi>Syrenus</hi> deſiring that their talke and conuerſation might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the time, place, and perſon with whom he talked, began to ſaie in this manner. I thinke it not (ſage Lady) much beyond the purpoſe, to demand a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine queſtion, to the perfect knowledge whereof, as I could neuer yet attaine; ſo do I not meanely deſire by your Ladiſhips wiſedome to be reſolued therein: and this it is. They do all affirme (that would ſeeme to know ſomething) <hi>That true Loue doth ſpring of reaſon:</hi> which if it be ſo, what is the reaſon, that there is not a more time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and vnruly thing in the worlde then loue, and which is left of all gouerned by it? As this Queſtion (anſwered
<hi>Felicia</hi>) is more then a ſimple Shepherdes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, ſo is it neceſſarie, that ſhe that muſt anſwer it, ought to haue more then a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie womans wit: But to ſatisfie thy minde with that little skill I haue, I am of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie opinion, affirming that Loue, though it hath Reaſon for his mother, is not therefore limited or gouerned by it. But it is rather to be ſuppoſed, that after rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of knowledge and vnderſtanding hath engendred it, it will ſuffer it ſelfe to be gouerned but fewe times by it. And it is ſo vnruly, that it reſultes oftentimes to the hurt and preiudice of the louer: ſince true louers for the moſt part fall to hate and neglect themſelues, which is not onely contrarie to reaſon, but alſo to the lawe of nature. And this is the cauſe why they paint him blinde, and void of all reaſon. And as his mother <hi>Venus</hi> hath moſt faire eies, ſo doth he alſo deſire the faireſt. They
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:23115:57"/>paint him naked, becauſe good loue can neither be diſſembled with reaſon, nor hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with prudence. They paint him with wings, becauſe he ſwiftly enters into the louers ſoule: and the more perfect he is, with more ſwiftnes and alienation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he goeth to ſeeke the perſon of the beloued, for which cauſe <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaide; That the louer did liue in the body of the beloued. They paint him alſo ſhooting his arrowes out of his bowe, becauſe he aymes right at the hart, as at his proper white: And alſo, becauſe the wound of loue is like that, which an arrow or dart ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, narrow at the entrance, and deepe in his inward ſoule that loueth. This is an inſcrutable, and almoſt incurable wounde, and very ſlowe in healing: So that thou muſt not maruell
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> that perfect loue (though it be the ſonne of reaſon) is not gouerned by it, bicauſe there is nothing, after it is borne, that doth leſſe conforme it ſelfe to the originall of his birth, then this doth. Some ſaie there is no other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene vertuous and vicious loue, but that the one is gouerned by reaſon, and the other not: but they are deceiued; becauſe exceſſe and force is no leſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to diſhoneſt, then to honeſt loue, which is rather a qualitie incident to euerie kinde of loue, ſauing the one doth make vertue the greater by it, and the other doth the more encreaſe vice. Who can denie, but that in true and honeſt loue exceſſiue and ſtrange effects are oftentimes founde? Aske it of many, who for the onely loue of God made no account of themſelues, and cared not to leeſe their liues for it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though knowing the reward they looked for, did not worke Io much in their minds. And how many againe (enflamed with the loue of vertue) haue gone about to caſt away themſelues, and to end their liues, to get thereby a glorious and ſuruiuing name? A thing truely, which ordinarie reaſon doth not permit, which doth rather guide euery effect in ſuch ſort, that the life may honeſtly preſerue it ſelfe. But what diuerſitie of examples could I bring thee <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> of many, who onely for the loue of their friendes haue loſt their liues, and euery thing that with life is loſt. But let vs leaue this loue, and come againe to that which nature hath bred betweene man and woman: wherein thou muſt know, that if the loue, which the louer beares to the miſtreſſe of his affections, (although burning in vnbridled deſire) doth ariſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of true knowledge and iudgement, as by her onely vertues he doth iudge her woorthy to be beloued, That this kinde of loue (in my opinion,) (and yet I am not deceiued) is neither vnlawfull nor diſhoneſt, bicauſe all loue being of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, doth tende to no other end but to loue the perſon beloued for her owne ſake, without hoping for any other guerdon or effect of his true, and ſincere loue. So that this is as much as (me thinkes) may be ſaide in anſwer of thy queſtion, which thou haſt put me.
<hi>Syrenus</hi> then ſaide vnto her. I am reſolued (ſage Lady) of that which I deſired to vnderſtande; and alſo belceue, that by your gracious wiſedome which is great, and bountie which is no leſſe, I ſhall be thorowly inſtructed of whatſoeuer I woulde deſire to know, although ſome finer capacitie then mine were more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to conceiue theſe deepe reaſons, ſo perfectly alledged by your learned aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syluenus,</hi> that was talking with <hi>Polydora,</hi> ſaide: It is ſtrange (faire Nymph) to ſee what a ſorrowfull hart (that is ſubiect to the traunces of impatient loue) doth ſuffer, becauſe the leſt ill, that it cauſeth in vs, is the depriuation of our iudgement, the loſſe of our memorie, and the ſurcharging of our imaginations with his onelſe obiects, making euery one to alienate himſelfe Iron, himſelfe, and to impropriate himſelfe in the perſon of his beloued. What ſhall that wofull man then do, who ſees himſelfe ſo great an enimie to pleaſure, ſuch a friende to ſolitarines, ſo full of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:23115:58"/>enuironed with feares, troubled in his ſpirits, martyred in his wits, ſuſtained by hope, wearied with thoughts, afflicted with griefes, haunted with iealouſies, and continually worne with ſobs, ſighes, ſorrowes, and woes, which he neuer wanteth? And that, which makes me more to maruel, is, that the mind doth not procure, (this loue being ſo vntolerable and extreme in crueltie) nor hath any deſire at all to part from it, but doth rather account it her enimie, that giues it any counſell to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. All this is true (ſaide <hi>Polydora</hi>) but I know well that Louers for the moſt part haue more words, then paſſions. This is a ſigne (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) that thou canſt not conceiue them (faire Nymph) becauſe thou canſt not beleeue them, nor that thou haſt beene euer touched with this pleaſing ill. And I wiſh thou maiſt not, the which none can beleeue, nor knowe the multitude of woes proceeding from it, but onlie ſhe that doth participate of his bitter effects. Why? doſt thou thinke (faire Nymph) when the louer that findes himſelfe continually confuſed, his reaſon obſcured, his memorie gone, his fancies and ſences wearied by exceſſiue loue, that his toong can then remaine ſo free, that it may faine paſſions, and ſhew another thing by words, then that he feeles by deedes? Ah deceiue not thy ſelfe with theſe wordes, which I know are cleane contrary to thy thought. Beholde heere am I, in whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that can be gouerned by reaſon; neither can he haue it, that is ſo much with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his libertie as I am, becauſe all corporall ſubiections do ſuffer the will (at the leaſt) to be free, but the bondage of loue is ſuch, that the firſt thing it takes in hand, is to conſtraine one, to make a profeſſion of it. And wilt thou Shepherdeſſe then beleeue, that he doth form complaints, &amp; faine ſighes, that ſees himſelfe handled in this ſort? It ſeemes well thou art free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loue, as I did but euen now tell thee. I know <hi>Syluanus</hi> (ſaide <hi>Polydor a</hi> againe) that louers are full of troubles, and afflicted in mind all the while they do not obtaine their deſires. Thou ſpeakeſt in a thing (ſaide <hi>Sylua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) wherein it ſeemes thou haſt no experience, bicauſe their loue, whoſe paines ceaſe after the accompliſhment of their deſires, proceedeth not from reaſon, but from a baſe and diſhoneſt appetite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seluagia, Beliſa,</hi> and faire <hi>Cynthia</hi> were talking togither, what the reaſon was that in abſence, loue did for the moſt part waxe colde. <hi>Beliſa</hi> coulde not beleeue, that for any thing in the worlde ſhe might entertaine ſuch diſloyaltie in her hart, ſaying: That ſince ſhe did beare her <hi>Arſileus</hi> (being now dead, and too well aſſured neuer to ſee him againe) the ſelfe ſame loue, that ſhe did, when he was aliue, howe much more then was it impoſſible for any other to forget that loue, which one doth hope ſometimes to ſee againe. I cannot anſwer thee <hi>Beliſa</hi> (ſaide the Nymph
<hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi>) ſo ſufficiently as perhaps this matter doth require, becauſe as it is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition, ſo the reſolution thereof is it not expected of a Nymphes witte and profeſſion. But yet this is my opinion, that though one departs from the preſence of her louer, yet the remembrance of him afterwards remaines in her eies, by the preſent occaſions wherof ſhe ſtill ſees the Idea of the thing that ſhe deſireth. The charge and office of this remembrance is to repreſent that to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which it conteineth in it, and of thinking of the perſon whom ſhe loueth, commeth will (the thirde power of the ſoule) to engender deſire, by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the perſon abſented ſuffereth paine, by not ſeeing that which ſhe loueth well. So that all theſe effects are deriued from the memorie, as from a fountaine, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence the beginning of deſire ſpringeth. But you muſt now knowe (faire Shepherdeſſes) that as the memorie is a thing, that the more it encreaſeth, the more it looſeth her ſtrength and vertue, for getting that which the eies did deliuer and put into it; ſo <pb n="107" facs="tcp:23115:58"/>likewiſe do the other powers, whoſe workes had their beginning in it, in the verie ſame ſort as riuers ſhould want their ſtreames, if the fountaines from whence they ſpring, did ceaſe to flowe. And as this is vnderſtoode of him that departs, ſo is it likewiſe of her that remaines ſtill. And whereas thou doſt thinke (faire Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) that time will not cure thy greefe by committing the remedie thereof into my Lady
<hi>Felicias</hi> handes, thou art much deceiued, becauſe there is not any, whom ſhe doth not helpe, and louers more then any other kinde of people.</p>
               <p>The ſage Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> (though ſhe was ſomewhat from them) heard what <hi>Cyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> ſaide, and anſwered. It might be thought no ſmall point of crueltie in me, to put the remedie of her greefes (who needes it ſo much) in the hands of ſo ſlowe and tedious a phiſition as time is: For though it be ſometimes a helpe, yet it fals out in the end, that the greateſt malladies (if they haue no other remedies then their own) do laſt ſo long a time that before they haue an ende, they ende their liues that haue them. And therefore becauſe I meane to be thinke me of that, which toucheth <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſmenaes</hi> eaſe, and the remedy of her greefes, and thoſe of all her companie, &amp; that now the beames of golden
<hi>Apollo</hi> ſeeme to make an ende of their daies iourney; I thinke it beſt to ſeale vp our diſcourſes, and to go in, bieauſe ſupper (I thinke) by this time is ſtaying for vs. And ſo they went into the great Ladies Pallace, where they founde the tables ready furniſhed and ſet vnder an arbour of greene vines, in a pleaſant and freſh garden within the houſe. And ſupper being ended, the ſage Lady praied <hi>Feliſmena</hi> to tell them ſome diſcourſe, were it a hiſtorie, or ſome nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accident, that had befallen in the Prouince of Vandalia? Which
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> did not denie: for with a ſober and gentle grace ſhe began to tell this hiſtory following.</p>
               <p>IN the time of the Valiant Prince <hi>Don Fernando,</hi> who was afterwards King of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, liued a knight in Spaine called <hi>Rodriga</hi> of
<hi>Naruaez,</hi> whoſe ſingular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and approoued manhood were ſo great, that as well in peace, as in war, he got the Sirname of the beſt knight of all thoſe that liued in his time; and where he did eſpecially winne it, when the ſame noble Prince ouercame the power of the
<hi>Moores</hi> at the citie of <hi>Antiquera,</hi> ſhewing by his great enterpriſes and martiall feates in this warre, an abſolute minde, an inuincible hart, and a noble kinde of liberalitie, by meanes whereof a good Captaine is not onely beloued, and highly eſteemed of his owne ſouldiers, but alſo of ſtrangers and his chiefeſt enimies: In regarde of which worthie ſeruice, hee was guerdoned after the ſubduing of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey (although but meanely in lieu of his high deſertes and excellent deedes) with the regiment of <hi>Antiquera</hi> and <hi>Allora,</hi> where hee ſpent moſt of his time with fiftie choiſe gentlemen at the Kings paie, for defence and garriſon of both thoſe frontier townes. All which by the good gouernment of their Captaine enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed many valiant deedes in defence of the Chriſtian faith, atchieuing them with great honour, and regiſtring the in perpetuall ſame with notable aduentures done in mainrenance of the ſame. Whoſe mindes therefore being ſo great enemies to idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and the exerciſe of armes ſo agreeable to the generous hart of their valiant Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour; it fell out that vpon a certaine ſommers night, <hi>Cynthia</hi> inuiting them to take part of the bright &amp; coole aire, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> with nine of his gentlemen (for thereſt remained in garriſon of the towne) armed at all points, went out of <hi>Allora,</hi> to ſurpriſe the Moores which lay on their frontiers, careleſſe (perheps) in their charge and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent. And emboldened by the priuiledge of the night, they paſſed by certaine waies neere vnto their townes. The valiant Captaine therefore going on with his <pb n="108" facs="tcp:23115:59"/>gentlemen as ſecret as he might, and verie carefull not to be diſcried, came to a way that parted into two, where conſulting to diuide themſelues into two companies of fiue a peece, and in ſuch ſort, that if the one company perceiued themſelues to be in any danger, by ſounding of a cornet they might be preſently aided by the other fiue. The Gouernor and fower of them tooke one way, and the other fiue an other: who riding in ſeuerall companies together, and talking of diuers matters, euerie one deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome aduenture to trie his manhood, and to ſhew himſelfe a couragious man at armes, as almoſt euerie day they were wont to doe, they heard not far from them a mans voice ſweetly ſinging, and now and then breathing out a profound ſigh; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they coniectured that ſome amorous paſſion did trouble his thoughts. The horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men therefore that heard this, rode into a little wood hard by the way, and becauſe the moone did ſhine as cleere as day, they might perceiue a <hi>Moore</hi> comming that way they went, ſo gallant and comely a genteleman, that his perſonage did well te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that he was of noble bloud, and ſingular valour. He came mounted vpon a daple graie horſe, and the garments he had on was a horſe-mans coate of crimoſin damaske, and vpon that a Barberie mantell fringed about with golde, and embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all ouer, and edged with many workes of ſiluer twiſt. He ware by his ſide a faire Moreſco Cymitarre, with taſſels of carnation ſilke and golde hanging at it; on his head a Tunez Turbant or roll of ſilke and white cotton, which was liſted with golde, and fringes of the ſame, which being wrapped many times about his head, did ſerue him for an ornament, and a defence of his perſon. He carried a great Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get on his left arme, and in his right hande a Launce of two punches: and with ſo goodly grace and countenance came the enamoured
<hi>Moore,</hi> that they coulde not wiſh to ſee a better ſight. But giuing attentiue eare vnto his ſong, they heard that the dittie (although it was in the Arabicke toong) ſaide thus.</p>

               <p>The fiue horſemen, who had perhaps but ſmall experience in amorous paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or whether they had or no, regarding more the intereſt, which ſo braue an aduenture did promiſe them, then the ſong of the enamoured <hi>Moore,</hi> iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the woode, and ranne with great violence vpon him. But the valiant <hi>More,</hi> who in like aſſaultes was a tried champion (though loue at that time was Lorde of his thoughtes) was not a whit diſmaied, but couching his launce in reſt, with woonderfull courage began to skitmiſh with them all, whom he made immediately knowe, that he was no leſſe valiant then amorous. Some ſay, they ſet vpon him by one and one, but they that haue ſought out the truth of this hiſtorie, aſſirme, that they ranne all vpon him at once, which is moſt like they did ſo, to take <pb n="109" facs="tcp:23115:59"/>him priſoner, but when they ſawe him begin to defende himſelfe, that then perhaps the other fower did ſtande by, whileſt one of them did fight with him alone. But howſoeuer it was, he droue them to ſuch a narrowe ſtreight, that caſting three of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ground, the other two very fiercely ſet vpon him, who needed not to vſe their ordinarie ſtrength againſt ſo valiant an aduerſarie; for though he was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one of his thighes, yet his ſtrength and courage was not of ſuch a temper, that mortall wounds could daunt his minde, nor make him leaue of that, which ſo highly touched his honour. But hauing by chance let fall his launce, he put ſpurs to his horſe making a ſhewe of flight, whom the two Chriſtians purſued at his verie heeles, which when he perceiued, he turned backe againſt them both, and paſſing thorow them like a furious and ſwift lightning, came to the place where one of the three laie, which he had vnhorſed, where ſtooping downe from his horſe to take vp his launce that lay by him, he mounted nymbly into the ſaddle againe: which one of the two horſemen ſeeing, and thinking they were not able to make their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie good, he ſounded his Cornet; but the <hi>Moore</hi> in the meane time ſo fiercely aſſailed them, that if the valiant Gouernour had not come, they had kept company with their other three companions, that lay hurt on the ground. But when the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour was come, and ſawe how valiantly the <hi>Moore</hi> did fight, he made great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him in his minde, and hauing an eagre deſire in ſingle combat to prooue his manhoode with him, he ſaide vnto him. Such is thy noble valour and rare ſtrength (braue knight) that by ouercomming thee, there cannot be but great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glorie got; which ſingular fauour if gentle Fortune would but grant me, I could not (by my life) requeſt any other at her handes. Wherein though I put my perſon in no ſmall danger, by offring him the combat, that can ſo brauely defende himſelfe, yet for a worlde I will not leaue it, when by ſo braue an enterpriſe, and howſoeuer I ſpeede, I cannot chuſe but winne great honor and renowne. And ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he badde his men ſtande aſide, appointing the conquered the priſe of the victorie. When they were both aſunder, a hot fight began betweene theſe valiant men at armes. The magnanimious <hi>Narudez</hi> deſired the victorie, becauſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the braue <hi>Moore</hi> encreaſed the glorie, that he hoped to get by it: And the ſtout <hi>Moore,</hi> to no other ende but to attaine to the effect of his hope and deſire. And ſo they belaied about them, paſſing actiue and nimble in lending blowes, and ſo hardie in aſſayling each others perſon, that had it not beene for the former wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, and wound that the
<hi>Moore</hi> had, (who by this time grewe ſomewhat faint by leeſing his blood) with great difficultie had the Gouenour got the happie victorie. But theſe impediments, and being not able to manage his horſe any longer, did promiſe it <hi>Naruaez</hi> cleerely; and not bicauſe he knew there wanted one iot of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or valour in the <hi>Moore,</hi> who (when he ſawe that in this ſingle combat his life was in hazard, which he woulde haue willingly changed for the contentment, which Fortune did then deny him) he r'enforced himſelfe with all his might, &amp; ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vptight in his ſtyrrops, gaue the Gouenour a dangerous thruſt, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vpon his target, who was not ſlacke in anſwering him with another vpon the right arme, and truſting to his ſtrength, if the matter came to handie gripes, at laſt he ranne in, and cloſed with him, and with ſuch force ſhaked him, that caſting him out of his ſaddle, he alſo fell with him to the ground, ſaying. Yeeld thy ſelfe knight, if thou makeſt any account of thy life, which is now in my hands. It is in thy hands (ſaid the <hi>Moore</hi>) to kil me as thou ſaiſt, but fortune ſhal neuer do me ſuch deſpite, to make me ouercommed by any, but onely by whom I haue long ſince ſuffered my ſelf <pb n="110" facs="tcp:23115:60"/>to be conquered.

The Gouernour did not then marke the <hi>Moore</hi> his words ſo much, nor to what end he ſpake them, but vſing the mercy that the valiant conquerour is woont to vſe to the forlorne man of Fortune, he helped him to riſe vp, and to binde vp his woundes, which were not ſo great, but that he might get vpon his horſe, and ſo all of them with their priſoner tooke the next way home to
<hi>Alora.</hi> The Gouernour as he rode, did continually caſt an eie vpon the <hi>Moore</hi> whom he thought with himſelfe, a goodly man of perſon, and gracious of viſage, remembring therewithall, howe ſtoutly he had defended himſelfe; but thought his ſadnes too great for ſo braue a minde as he carried; and becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed his ſorrow with ſighes, which were tokens of greater greefe, then could be imagined in ſo braue a man, and alſo deſirous to knowe more of the matter, he ſaid vnto him. Behold Sir knight, how the priſoner that leeſeth his hart &amp; magnanimitie for feare of impriſonment, doth hazard the law of his libertie, and that in Martiall affaires, aduerſitie muſt be entertayned with as merrie a countenance, as by this greatnes of minde it may deſerue to enioy proſperitie againe. And theſe ſighes are not (me thinkes) beſeeming that valour and courage, which thou haſt ſhewed by tryall of thy perſon; neither are thy wounds ſo mortall, that thy life is in hazarde, whereof beſides thou haſt ſhewed not to make ſo much account, but that thou wouldeſt willingly haue left it for thine honours ſake: If there be then any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of thy heauines, tell it me: for by the faith of a gentleman, I ſweare vnto thee, that I will vſe as much curteſie and friendſhip towards thee, as thou ſhalt not haue occaſion to repent thee, that thou haſt tolde me it. The
<hi>Moore</hi> hearing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours gentle ſpeech, whereby he argued in him a braue and noble minde, and his curteous and friendly offer to helpe him, thought it no point of wiſedome to conceale the cauſe of his greefe from him, becauſe by his milde wordes and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous countenance he had ſuch great hope of helpe and fauour, that lifting vp his face, which with the waight of ſorrow he went carying in his boſome, he ſaide vnto him. How art thou called Sir Knight, that doſt thus comfort me in my ſadneſſe, whereof thou ſeemeſt to haue ſome feeling, and the which thou doſt enforce me to tell thee. My name is <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaez,</hi> and Gouernour I am of <hi>Alora,</hi> and Antiquera, of both which townes of garriſon the King of Aragon my Lord and Maſter, hath appointed me Chiefetaine. When the
<hi>Moore</hi> heard this, with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier countenance then before, he ſaid: I am glad that my misfortune hath beene ſo fortunate, to make me fall into thy handes; of whoſe force and manhoode I haue beene long ſince informed, the triall whereof though it had coſt me deerer, coulde not haue greatly greeued me, ſince it doth ſo greatly content me to ſee my ſelfe his priſoner, whoſe vertues, valour, and dexteritie in armes doth importune euery ones eares ſo much. And becauie the ſubduing of my perſon doth oblige me to eſteeme thee the more, and that thou maiſt not thinke it is any kinde of puſyllanimitie, or feare in me (without ſome other great occaſion, which lies not in my power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake) that makes me ſo ſad and penſiue, I praie thee gentle Knight, by that thou art, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand thy gentlemen to ride on before, becauſe thou maiſt know, that neither the paine of my greene woundes, nor the greefe of my preſent captiuitie is cauſe of my heauie thoughts. The Gouernour hearing theſe words, made greater reckoning of the <hi>Moore,</hi> and becauſe he was verie deſirous to be thorowly reſolued what he was, he willed his gentlemen to ride on before: and they two comming on faire and ſoftly behind, the <hi>Moore</hi> fetching a profound ſigh from his ſoule, began thus to ſaie.</p>

                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:23115:60"/>IF time and triall of thy great virtues (moſt valiant Gouernour) and that golden fame wherewith they are ſpread in euery place, had not penetrated my hart with deſire of knowing them, &amp; now put them manifeſtly before mine eles, theſe words, which thy will doth enforce me to relate, ſhould be now excuſed, and the diſcourſe, which I meane to tell thee of a life, continually enuironed with diſquiets &amp; ſuſpects (the leaſt whereof being (as thou wilt iudge no leſſe) worſe then a thouſand deaths) remaine vntold. But as I am on the one ſide aſſured of that I ſpeake, and that (on the other) thou art a worthie kinght, and noble gentleman, and haſt either heard, or els thy ſelfe paſſed the like paſſion to mine, <hi>Know, that my</hi> name is
<hi>Abyndaraez</hi> the yoonger in difference of an vncle of mine, my fathers brother who is alſo called ſo. Deſcended I am from the noble houſe of the <hi>Abencerrajes</hi> in <hi>Granada,</hi> by whoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckie deſtinies I did learne to be vnfortunate. And becauſe thou maiſt know what theirs was, and maiſt by them the better coniecture, what may be expected of mine,
<hi>Thou</hi> ſhalt vnderſtand, that in <hi>Granada</hi> was a noble linage of Lords, and Knights, called <hi>Abencerrajes,</hi> whoſe valiant deeds, and graue perſonages, as well in martiall aduentures, as in peaceable and wiſe gouernment of our common-wealth, were the mirrours of that kingdome. The olde men were of the Kings counſell; the yoong gentlemen exerciſed their minds, and bodies in feates of armes, in the ſeruice of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and gentlewomen, and by ſhewing in euery point their valour and gentilitie. And as they were honoured of the popular ſort, and welbeloued among the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, (for in all thoſe good parts that a gentleman ſhould haue, they farre excelled others) ſo were they very well thought of with the King: They did neuer any thing in war abroad, nor in counſell at home, that their experience was not correſpondent to their expectation: whoſe valour, bountie, and humanitie was ſo highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for a common example it was euer alleaged, That there was neuer <hi>Aben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerraje</hi> coward, niggard, or ill diſpoſed perſon. In the citie they were the maſters of braue inuentions for apparell: In the Court, of maskes, daunces, and triumphes, and in the court and citie, in the ſeruice and courting of Dames paſſing gracious: For neuer did <hi>Abencerraje</hi> loue and ſerue any Ladie, of whom he was not fauoured, nor any Ladie (were ſhe neuer ſo faire and amiable) thinke her ſelfe worthie of the name &amp; title of an <hi>Abencerraje</hi> his miſtreſſe. They liuing therfore in as great proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, honor, and reputation, that might be, came fortune (an enemie to the reſt and contentment of happie men) to caſt them downe from that ioyfull eſtate, to the moſt vnfortunate and greeuous condition of diſgrace that might be. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof was, that the King hauing done a certaine iniury to the
<hi>Abencerrajes,</hi> they made an inſurrection, wherein, with ten gentlemen more of their kinred, they conſpired to kill the King, land to diuide the kingdome amongſt themſelues, &amp; ſo to be reuenged of the vnworthie diſgrace receiued by him. This conſpitacie (whether it was true or falſe) was diſcouered before it could be put in practiſe, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and condemned to die, before the citizens had intelligence thereof; who, without all doubt for the great loue they bare them, would haue riſen, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that iuſtice ſhould haue beene done vpon them; For, carying them to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quution, it was the ſtrangeſt ſpectacle in the world, to ſee the lamentations that ſome made; the priuie murmuring of one to another; and the bootleſſe excuſes, that for compaſſion of theſe gentlemen were generally made in all the citie. They ran all to the King, and offered to buie his mercie with great ſummes of gold and ſiluer; but ſuch was his ſeueritie, that it expelled all motions of pitie and clemencie:
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23115:61"/>Which when the people beheld, they began to weepe, and lament againe: The Lords, Knights and gentlemen did weepe and mourne, with whom they were wont to keepe companie: The tender Ladies and Damſels of the Court wept, whom they loued and ſerued: And all the whole citie wept, for the great honour and auctority, that ſuch noble citizens gaue them. The lamentations, and outcries were ſo many, and ſo loud, as if the earth had ſunke, or the world beene drowned anew. But the King, who to all theſe teares, lamentations, and pitifull outcries did ſtop his eares, commaunded, that his definitiue ſentence ſhould be preſently executed: So that, of all that houſe, and linage there remained not one man aliue, that was not behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that day, except my father and mine vncle, who were not found complices in that conſpiracie. Theſe ils reſulted to them (beſides this miſerable chaunce) that their houſes were ruinated; they proclaimed traitours to the King; their goodes, lands, and poſſeſſions confiſcated: And that no
<hi>Abenceraje</hi> ſhould liue any longer in <hi>Granada,</hi> except my father and mine vncle; and they but with this condition, that if they had any iſſue, they ſhould ſend the men children (as ſoon as they were borne) to be brought vp out of the citie, neuer to returne into it againe; and if they were women, and marriageable, to be married out of the Realme. When the Gouernor heard the ſtrange diſcourſe of <hi>Abyndaraez,</hi> and the termes wherewith he complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his misfortune, he could not ſtop his teares, but did ſhew by them the ſenſible greefe, which of ſuch a diſaſtrous accident could not be but felt. And therefore turning himſelfe to the Moore, ſaide vnto him. Thou haſt good cauſe <hi>Abyndaraes,</hi> to be ſorrie for the fall of thy noble houſe and kinred, whoſe heads (I thinke) coulde neuer hatch ſo great treaſon: And were it for no other proofe, but that ſo worthie a gentleman as thy ſelfe came out of it, this onely were ſufficient to make me beleeue, that they neuer pretended ſuch wickednes. This gentle opinion, which thou haſt of me (ſaid the Moore) and of the goodnes of my aunceſtors, I know not (worthie Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour) how to requite, but onely with vnfained and humble thankes. But now, when I was borne into the world, with the inheritance of the ſelfe ſame miſhap of my kinred, they ſent me (becauſe they would not infringe the Kings edict) to be nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and brought vp in a certaine fort, belonging ſometimes to the Chriſtians, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Cartama,</hi> committing the charge and care of me to the Gouernor thereof, with whom my father had ancient familiaritie &amp; acquaintance: A man of great account in the kingdome, vpright in the maner of his life, and verie rich, but chiefly in a daughter that he hath, which is the greateſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

And by the extreme paſſion of my loue, driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of my muſing, I went to her, who, as ſoone as ſhe ſaw me, with open armes came to receiue me: And ſitting vpon the <pb n="113" facs="tcp:23115:61"/>fountaine by her, ſhe ſaid vnto me. Why haſt thou (good brother) left me ſo long alone? It is (ſweete Ladie) ſaid I againe, a good while ſince I hauing ſought thee in euerie place, &amp; found not any, that could tell me what was become of thee, my hart at laſt coniectured where thou wert: Buttel me now (I pray thee) what certaintie haſt thou, that we are brother and ſiſter?

               <p>Theſe wordes were of ſuch force, that, being helped by the loue of her, in whoſe praiſe they were ſung, I ſaw her ſhed certaine teares, that I cannot tell you now (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gouernour) how much they moued my hart, nor whether the content, that I had by ſeeing ſo true a teſtimonie of my Miſtreſſe loue, or the greefe, (my ſelfe being the occaſion of her teares) was greater. Calling me to her, ſhe made me ſit downe by her, and thus began to ſay vnto me. If the Loue <hi>Abyndaraez,</hi> whereunto I am obliged (after I was fully aſſured of thy thoughtes) is but ſmall, or ſuch, that cannot but with extinction of life be ended, my wordes (I hope) before we leaue this onely place, ſhall make thee ſufficiently knowe. And blame thee I will not for thy miſtruſt, which hath made thee conceiue amiſſe; for I knowe it is ſo ſure a thing to haue it, as there is nothing more proper and incident to Loue. For remedie whereof, and of the ſorrow that I muſt needes haue, by ſeeing my ſelfe at any time ſeparated from thy ſweete companie, from this day forth for euer thou maiſt hold and eſteeme thy ſelfe ſuch a Lord and Maſter of my libertie, as thou ſhalt be indeede, if thou art wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to combine thy ſelfe in ſacred bondes of marriage with me, the refuſall where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is (before euery other thing) no ſmall impediment to both our contents, a preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to mine honour, and the ſole obſtacle of enioying the great loue which I beare thee. When I heard theſe wordes (Loue working my thoughts to things cleane contrarie) I conceiued ſuch great ioy, that had it not beene but by onely bowing downe my knees to the ground, and kiſſing her faire handes, I was not able to doe any other thing. With the hope of theſe wordes I liued certaine daies, in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ioy in the world, whileſt mutable Fortune (enuying my proſperitie and ioyfull life) bereaued vs both of this ſweete contentment: for not long after, the King of <hi>Granada</hi> minding to prefer the Gouernour of <hi>Cartama</hi> to ſome higher charge, by his letters commanded him foorthwith to yeeld vp the charge of that Fort, which lies vpon the frontires, and goe to <hi>Coyn,</hi> where his pleaſure was he ſhould be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and Gouernour, and alſo to leaue me in <hi>Cartama</hi> vnder the charge of him, that came to be Gouernour in his place. When I heard theſe vnluckie newes for my Miſtreſſe and my ſelfe, iudge you (noble Gentleman, if at any time you haue beene a louer) what a world of greefe we conceiued. We went both into a ſecret place to weepe, and lament our misfortunes, and the departure and loſſe of each others companie. There did I call her my ſoueraine Miſtreſſe mine onely ioy, my hope, and other names, that Loue did put into my mouth: with weeping I ſaide vnto her. When the viewe of thy rare beautie ſhall be taken from mine eies, wilt thou then
<hi>Xarifa,</hi> ſometimes remember me? Heere did my teares and ſighes cut off my words, and inforcing my ſelfe to ſpeake more (being troubled in minde) I vttered I know not what fooliſh wordes vnto her: for the apprehended abſence of my deere Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe in my thoughts did vtterly carry away my wits, ſenſes, and memorie with it. But who can tell what ſorrow my deere Lady felt for this departure, and what bitter <pb n="116" facs="tcp:23115:63"/>potions of greefe her orientall teares, (which for this croſſe of fortune ſhe powred forth) made me ſup vp? She did then ſpeake ſuch wordes vnto me, the leſt of which was ynough, to haue made the hardeſt hart thought of a ſorrowfull departure for euer: which (valiant Gouernour) I will omit to tell thee, bicauſe thou wilt thinke them (if thy breſt was neuer poſſeſſed with loue) impoſſible. And if it hath beene for feare, leſt by hearing ſome of them, thou couldeſt not, but with hazard of life, ſtay out to heare the reſt. Let it ſuffice, that the end of them, was by telling me, that, hauing any fit occaſion by her fathers ſicknes, or by his abſence, ſhe would ſende for me, that, that might haue effect, which was betrothed and agreed vpon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs both. With this promiſe my hart was ſomewhat lightned, and for this infinite curteſie, (which ſhe did promiſe me when time and occaſion ſerued) I kiſſed her daintie hands. The next day after, they went away, and I tarried ſtill behinde, like one that (wandring vpon craggie and wilde mountaines, and hauing loſt the comfortable light of the ſunne) remained in hideous darknes: with great greefe I began to feele her abſence, and ſought all the falſe remedies (I could) againſt it: for ſometimes I did caſt mine eies vp to the windowes, where ſhe was woont to looke out; ſometimes vpon the bed where her tender body was accuſtomed to take reſt; and went ſomtimes into the garden, where daily ſhe vſed to diſport herſelfe, and in the heate of the day to the chriſtalline fountaine, where ſhe bathed and refreſhed herſelfe vnder the ſhade of Limon and Pomegranate trees: I walked and went all her ſtations, and in euery one of them I found a certaine repreſentation of my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull thoughts. Truth it is, that the hope that ſhe gaue me (to ſend for me) eaſed my paines a little, and with it I diſſembled ſome part of my woes. But for as much as the continuall thought of my deſire ſo long deferred, did encreaſe my paine the more, me thought ſometimes I would haue beene glad, if I had beene left altogither without hope, for deſperation doth but trouble one, vntill it be certainly knowen; but hope, vntill the deſire be accompliſhed. But my good Fortune did ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour me, that this morning my Lady ſtoode to her worde, by ſending for me by a gentlewoman of hers (a truſtie ſecretarie of her thoughts) for the Gouernour her Father was gone to Granada, who being ſent for thither by the king, was to returne home in a ſhort time againe. Awaked out of my heauie ſlumber and melancholike cares with theſe inopinate and happie newes, I prepared my ſelfe to go with winged ſpeede vnto her: yet ſtaying for night, and becauſe I might the better eſcape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, I did put on this habite, as thou ſeeſt, and the braueſt I could deuiſe, to make the better ſhewe to my Lady of my proud and ioyfull hart. In which iourney (truely) I would not haue thought, that two of the beſt knights at armes had beene ſufficient to abide me the fielde, becauſe I carried my Miſtreſſe with me. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rodrigo</hi> if thou haſt ouercomed me, it was not by pure ſtrength, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but it was either my harde fortune, or the determination of the heauens, that woulde preuent me of ſuch a ſupreme good. Whereupon conſider nowe in the end of my true tale, and of the good that I haue loſt, and the ill which I poſſeſſe: I came from Cartama to go to Coyn, but a ſhort iourney, although the deſire of the proudeſt <hi>Abencerraje</hi> that euer liued, made it a great deale longer. I went, ſent for by my Lady, to ſee my Lady, to enioy my Lady, and to marrie my ſweeteſt Ladie. But now I ſee my ſelfe wounded, captiue, and in ſubiection to him, who will doe, I know not what with me. And that which greeues me moſt, is, that the time and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying of my deſire, endeth with this preſent night. O ſuffer me then Chriſtian to comfort my ſelfe at the leaſt with my ſecret lamentations: let me euacuate out of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:23115:63"/>my ſorowfull breſt my choking and ſmothering ſighes, and water mine eies with burning teares: All which impute not to any imbecillitie or feare of minde, though it were a great deale better for me that I had a hart, that coulde beare and ſuffer this harde and ſiniſtrous chance of Fortune, then to do that which I now do.</p>
               <p>The diſcourſe of the enamoured <hi>Moore</hi> pearced deepely into the valiant <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaes</hi> his ſoule, who was not a little amazed at the ſtrange ſucceſſe of his loue. And thinking with himſelfe, that for the better diſpatch of his affaires, nothing might hinder them more, then his long ſtaying, he ſaid vnto him. I am minded
<hi>Abyndaraes,</hi> to make thee knowe how much my vertue ſurmounteth thy ill fortune, for if thou wilt but promiſe me to returne to my priſon within three daies, I will ſet thee at libertie, bicauſe thou maiſt not leaue of thy amotous enterpriſe. For it woulde greeue me to cut off ſo good, and honeſt an endeuour. The <hi>Abenceraje</hi> hearing this, in token of thankes would haue fallen downe at his feete, and ſaide vnto him. If thou doſt me this vnexpected fauour (noble Gouernour of <hi>Alora</hi>) thou ſhalt reſtore me againe to life, and ſhew the greateſt gentilitie of minde, that euer any Conquerour did. Take what ſecuritie thou wilt of me, for whatſoeuer thou doſt demaund, I will not faile to accompliſh. Then
<hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaes</hi> called his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vnto him, and ſaide. Gentlemen, truſt me for this priſoner, for whoſe raunſome my ſelfe will be a pledge. They anſwered him againe, that he might diſpoſe of him at his owne pleaſure, for whatſoeuer he did, they would be well content withall. Then the Gouernour taking the <hi>Abenceraje</hi> by his right hand, ſaide vnto him. Doſt thou promiſe me as thou art a Gentleman to come to my Caſtell of <hi>Alora,</hi> there to yeelde thy ſelfe my priſoner within three daies? I doe (ſaide he) and with ſolemne othe binde it. Then goe (ſaide the Gouernour) and good fortune with thee, and if thou ſtandeſt in neede of mine owne perſon to accompany thee, or of any other thing for thy way, ſpeake, and thou ſhalt haue it. The <hi>Moore</hi> thanked him very much, but tooke no more but a horſe, which the Gouernour gaue him, for his owne was hurt in the late encounter betweene them, and went very heauie, being alſo wearied and faint with much blood, which he loſt by the way: and ſo turning the raines, he rode as faſt as he coulde towardes
<hi>Coyn. Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaes</hi> and his Gentlemen returned homewardes to <hi>Alora,</hi> talking by the way of the valour and goodly behauiour of the <hi>Abenceraje.</hi> The <hi>Moore</hi> was not long (according to the great ſpeede he made) in comming to the Fort of
<hi>Coyn,</hi> where, going directly as he was commanded, he firſt went about all the wals, vntill at laſt he found a poſterne gate, and the Centrinels on the wals faſt aſleepe, who though he had a great deſire, and made no leſſe haſte to enter in, yet he ſtaied a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, looking about him on euery ſide, leaſt happily he might be eſpied, or in danger of ſome thing elſe. But when he perceiued that all was quiet, he knocked with the punch of his launce at the wicket (for that was the watchworde, that his Miſtreſſe had giuen him by the gentlewoman that went to call him) the which was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately opened vnto him by the ſame gentlewoman, who ſaide vnto him: Sir your long tarying hath put my Ladie in a great feare, for ſhe hath ſtaide this good while for you. Alight and I will bring you vp where ſhe is attending your preſence in great perplexitie: he then diſmounted from his horſe, and ſet him vp in a ſecret place, that he founde there, where alſo leauing his Launce againſt a wall with his Target and Cymitarre, the gentlewoman tooke him by the hande, and very ſoftly led him vp a paire of ſtaires, for feare of being heard by them in the caſtle, and brought him into <hi>Xarifaes</hi> chamber. Before whom when he was come, with a ſudden ſurſault of ioye <pb n="118" facs="tcp:23115:64"/>ſhe ranne to receiue him, and both of them with ſuch extreme paſſions of loue and gladnes embracing one another, were not able to ſpeake one worde, for the infinite ioy they had at each others ſight: But comming to themſelues againe, at the laſt ſhe ſaide thus vnto him. What the cauſe may be, that thou haſt ſtaied ſo long (my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Lord) I knowe not, but what ſorrowe and anxieties of minde I haue paſſed for thy ſlowe comming, my impatient loue is able to teſtifie. I hope, thou doſt imagine faire Lady (ſaide he againe) that it is not by my fault and negligence, but mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes doe not alwaies fall out fit to their deſires: So that if there be any trueth in me, thou maiſt well beleeue me, that it was not in my power to come ſooner then I haue done. But breaking him off in his excuſes, ſhe tooke him by the hand, &amp; leading him into a rich chamber, they ſat them downe vpon a faire bed, where thus ſhe ſaid vnto him. I was deſirous my thriſe beloued
<hi>Abyndaraes,</hi> to haue thee ſee, how cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues in loue can fulfill their promiſe; for, from the very day, that I gaue thee my word for pledge of my hart, I haue ſought the meanes to diſcharge me of it. I ſent for thee to come to this Caſtell, to be my priſoner, as I am thine. But now I haue brought thee in hither, to make thee Lord of me, and of my fathers treaſure, vnder the honourable name of a lawfull husband, whereunto my eſtate, nor thy loyaltie cannot otherwiſe conſent. I do knowe well, that my fathers will wilbe contrarie to our workings, who being ignorant of thy valour, and not knowing thy deſerts, as well as I doe, will perhaps beſtowe ſome richer husband on me: but I eſteeme thy noble perſonage, and thy vertuous and valiant mind more, then the greateſt riches in the world. And hauing ſaide thus vnto him, ſhe hung downe her head, bluſhing not a little, that ſhe had ſo much diſcouered her ſelfe, and in ſo plaine and open termes declared her affection vnto him. The noble <hi>Moore</hi> tooke her in his armes, and many times kiſſing her white hands for ſuch louing and curteous wordes, ſaide thus vnto her. I haue no new thing (ſweete Lady of my ſoule) to giue thee in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of ſuch great good as thou doſt offer me, bicauſe I am no leſſe (as I was before) wholy thine. Onely this pledge I giue thee in token of my vnſpeakable loue, that I receiue thee for my beloued Lady and wife: And heerewithall thou maiſt lay aſide for a while that modeſt ſhamefaſtnes, and maidenly teynt, which continually thou haſt had, ſince thou haſt taken me for thine owne. Vnwillingly ſhe did the ſame: And vpon this concluſion they went to bed, where with a new experience they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled the flames of their enamoured harts. In which amorous enterpriſe, paſſed on either ſide many louing wordes, and deedes fitter for imagination, then to be written. The <hi>Moore</hi> being in ſo great ioy and pleaſure, fetched on the ſudden a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and painfull ſigh, and turning from her, began to lie ſo ſad and penſiue, that faire
<hi>Xarifa</hi> perceiuing it, was much amazed and troubled in minde to ſee ſo ſudden an alteration: who lying ſtill, heard him breath foorth a deepe and dolefull ſigh with turning his body on euery ſide. The Lady vnable to ſuffer ſo great an iniurie to her beautie and loyaltie, thinking he was diſpleaſed with the one or both, riſing vp a little in the bedde, with a milde and merrie voice (though ſomewhat troubled) ſaide vnto him. What meanes this <hi>Abyndaraes?</hi> It ſeemes thou art offended with my mirth. I heard thee ſigh, and tumble, and toſſe thy body on euery ſide: why man, if I am wholy thy ioye, and thy delight, why doſt thou not tell me for whom thou doſt ſigh; and if I am not, why haſt thou thus deceiued me? If thou haſt found any fault in my perſon, that hath abridged the delight of thy imagination, caſt thine eies and minde vpon my will, which is ſufficient to ſupply many wants, and vpon my zealous and louing hart, that wiſheth it the faireſt and fineſt in the world for thy <pb n="119" facs="tcp:23115:64"/>ſake. If thou ſerueſt any other Lady, let me know her, that I may ſerue her to: And if thou haſt any other greefe (which ſhall not offend me) tell it me, for I will either die, or rid thee from it. And claſping him with a kinde of violent and forcible loue, ſhe turned him to her againe, who being then confounded, and aſhamed for that he had done, and thinking that it might be an occaſion (if he did not tell her the cauſe of his ſorrow) to fill her head full of iealouſie and ſuſpicion, with an appaſſionate ſigh he ſaid vnto her. If I did not (my ſweeteſt life) loue thee more then mine owne ſoule, I woulde neuer haue made ſuch ſignes of inwarde greefe, for the wounding thoughts, which I brought with me (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I came with my ſelfe all alone) I paſſed away with a better hart; but now that I am conſtrained to go from thee, I haue no force to endure them at all. And becauſe thou ſhalt be no longer in ſuſpence of knowing the cauſe of my ſorrow, I will tell thee what lately paſſed: And then he told her all the matter, not leauing any thing out, in the end of his tale with many teares ſaying thus vnto her. So that thy captiue (faire Lady) is alſo priſoner to the Gouernour of
<hi>Alora:</hi> And the paine of that impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which thou haſt caſt vpon me, and taught my hart to ſuffer, I feele not, but the torment and bondage by liuing without thee, I account woorſe then any death: Wherupon thou ſeeſt, that my ſighes are rather arguments of greater loyalty, then of any want thereof. And with this, he began againe to be ſo penſiue and ſad, as he was before he had tolde her his greefe. But then with a merrie countenance ſhe ſaid vnto him: Trouble not thy minde <hi>Abyndaraes</hi> with theſe thoughts, for I will take the care and remedie of this greefe vpon mee, as a thing that toucheth mee moſt of all; and the more, ſince it is not denied any priſoner that hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his worde to returne to priſon, to ſatisfie it, by ſending the ranſome that ſhall be demaunded of him: Wherefore ſet thy ſelfe downe what ſumme thou wilt, for I haue the keyes of al my fathers treaſure, which I will put into thy hands, &amp; leaue it all at thy diſpoſition. <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaez</hi> is a curteous gentleman, &amp; a good knight, and one who gaue thee once thy libertie: And as thou haſt acquainted him with the truſt of theſe affaires; ſo is he now the more bound to vſe greater virtue and gentlenes towardes thee. I am ſure he will be contented with reaſon; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thee in his power and priſon, he muſt perforce ſet thee at libertie, when he hath the value of thy ranſome. I ſee well faire Ladie (ſaid the <hi>Abencerraje</hi> againe) that the loue which thou doſt beare me, will not ſuffer thee to giue me the beſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, for I will neuer commit ſo foule a fault as this. For if I was bound to fulfill my word, when I was alone, and without thee, now that I am thine, the bond is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: I will therefore returne to <hi>Allora,</hi> and yeeld my ſelfe into the Gouernors hands, and when I haue done what I am bound to do, let Fortune do with me what ſhe will. Nay let me rather die, ſaide <hi>Xarifa</hi> (if thou goeſt to be priſoner) then once deſire to remaine here at libertie. For being thy captiue, by duetie I am bound to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thee in this iourney for the extreme loue that I beare thee, whereas alſo the feare of my fathers frownes, which I haue purchaſed by offending him, will let me do no leſſe. The <hi>Moore</hi> weeping for ioy, to heare theſe words, embraced her ſaying. Thou neuer ceaſeſt (my deereſt ſoule) to heape fauours vpon my happie head, do therefore what thou wilt, for this is my reſolution. With this determination they roſe before it was day, and prouiding ſome neceſſarie things for their iourney, they went verie ſecretly towards <hi>Allora:</hi> and when the day began to waxe cleere, <hi>Xarifa</hi> went with her face couered with a maske, for feare of being knowen, and by reaſon of the greath aſte they made, they came in good time to <hi>Alora,</hi> where going directly to <pb n="120" facs="tcp:23115:65"/>the caſtle, &amp; knocking at the gate, it was opened to them out of hand by the Centri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, who had notice of that was paſt, and what they ſhould do. The valiant Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor receiued them curteouſly: and <hi>Abyndaraes</hi> going to the gate and taking his wiſe by the hand brought her vnto him, &amp; ſaid. Behold <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaez</hi> if I keepe not well my word and appointed time? For promiſing thee to returne thy priſoner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteed of one, I bring thee two, for one was enough to ouercome many. Behold here my Ladie, &amp; iudge if I haue not iuſtly ſuffered for her ſake: accept vs now for thine, for in thy virtuous and noble minde I repoſe my whole truſt and confidence, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hands commit her deere and chiefeſt honour. The Gouernor was verie glad to ſee them both, and ſaid to <hi>Xarifa:</hi> I know not faire Ladie which of you haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered each other in loue and curteſie, but truely thinke my ſelfe greatly bound vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you both. Come in therefore, and reſt you in your owne houſe, the which from henceforth, as alſo the maſter of it, accept for none other. After this friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement, they went with him into his dining chamber, where after a little while they refreſhed themſelues, bicauſe they came ſomewhat wearie. The Gouernor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the <hi>Moore</hi> how he did for his wounds. I thinke (ſaid he) that what with the way, and what with paine, they are ſomewhat rankled: which faire <hi>Xarifa</hi> hearing, with an altered an appalled countenance ſaid vnto him. Alas how comes this to paſſe my Lord? Haue you any woundes about you, and I not knowe them? Who eſcapes (ſaide he) from thine, needes little to care for any other. Truth it is, that at our late skirmiſh in the night I got two little woundes, which my troubleſome iourney and negligence in curing them hath made ſomewhat worſe, but all is but little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It is beſt (ſaide the Gouernour) that you lay you downe, and I will ſend for a Chirurgeon that is heere in the Caſtell to cure them. Following which counſell, faire <hi>Xarifa</hi> cauſed him to put off his apparell, and though ſhe ſet a good face on the matter (bicauſe ſhe woulde not giue him any occaſion to feele her inwarde greefe) yet was ſhe altered much and troubled in her minde. The Chirurgeon came, and ſearching his wounds ſaide, that they were not dangerous, bicauſe the ſigne was not in thoſe places when he receiued them; and alſo, bicauſe they were ſmitten ouerthwart, would not be long in healing: For with a certaine ointment that he made out of hand, the paine of them was ſomewhat aſſwaged; and in fower daies (by meanes of the great care the Chirurgeon had in healing them) hee was as ſound and whole as euer he was before. But one day, after dinner was done, the <hi>Abenceraje</hi> ſaide thus vnto the Gouernour. As you are wiſe, <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of
<hi>Naruaez,</hi> ſo can you not chooſe, but by the manner of our being at
<hi>Coyn,</hi> and of our comming hither, imagine more then you haue ſeene, which affaires of ours by our owne miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes (driuen to this deſperate (though happy) euent, wherein they nowe are) muſt be (I hope) by your aduiſe and helpe brought to ſome good end. This is faire <hi>Xarifa,</hi> of whom I tolde you: This is my Lady, and my deerely beloued wife: In
<hi>Coyn</hi> ſhe woulde not ſtay for feare of her Father. For though he knowes not what hath paſſed betweene vs, yet ſhe feared leaſt this accident at ſome time or other might be diſcouered. Her Father is nowe with our King of <hi>Granada,</hi> whoſe highneſſe I know, doth beare you eſpeciall good will, and loueth you, (though you be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an) for your valour and vertuous diſpoſition. Wherefore I beſeech you (gentle knight) to ſollicite our pardon at his gracious hands for dooing what is paſt without his leaue and priuitie, ſince Fortune hath brought it (though happily) to this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full paſſe. Comfort your ſelues
<hi>Abyndaraes</hi> and faire <hi>Xarifa</hi> (ſaid the noble Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) for by the faith of a gentleman I promiſe you to do what I can for you in this
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:23115:65"/>behalfe, whereupon he preſently called for inke and paper to write a letter to the king of <hi>Granada,</hi> which in a few words and true, opening their eſtate vnto him, ſaid thus.</p>
               <p>MOſt mightie king of <hi>Granada, Rodrigo</hi> of
<hi>Naruaez</hi> the Gouernour of <hi>Alora,</hi> by theſe letters kiſſeth your royall hands, and giues your Maieſtie to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that <hi>Abyndaraez Abencerraje</hi> borne in <hi>Granada,</hi> brought vp in
<hi>Cartama</hi> and being vnder the charge and gouernment of the captaine of that Forte, was enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of <hi>Xarifa</hi> his faire daughter: And after that it pleaſed your Maieſtie to preferre the ſaide captaine to the gouernment of <hi>Coyn,</hi> the two louers (to binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in a mutall and indiſſoluble bonde) betrothed their faith to each other before her departure, who ſent to <hi>Cartama</hi> for the <hi>Abencerraje</hi> in her Fathers abſence (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now in your Maieſties Court) to whom as he was going to <hi>Coyn,</hi> in the way I met him, and in a certaine skirmiſh betweene vs, (wherein he ſhewed himſelfe a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and couragious man at armes) made him my priſoner: who telling me his piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe (my hart being mooued with compaſſion of his greefe, and with his earneſt praiers) I ſet him free for two daies, who went his way, and got him to his wife, ſo that in that iourney he woone his wife, and loſt his libertie. But ſeeing the <hi>Abencer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raje</hi> (according to his worde) woulde needes returne to my priſon, ſhe came alſo with him, and ſo they are both now in my power. Let not the name of <hi>Abencerraje,</hi> I beſeech your Maieſtie offende it, for this Gentleman and his Father were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie (as I haue heard) nor conſenting to the conſpiracie pretended againſt your roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſon, in teſtimonie whereof, they are yet both liuing. Wherefore I humblie beſeech your Maieſtie to impart-betweene your Grace and me a remedie for theſe hapleſſe louers, whoſe raunſome I will frankely forgiue, and freely let them go. May it onely pleaſe your Maieſtie to procure the Ladies pardon with her Father, who is your ſubiect, and to intreat him to receiue the gentleman into his affinitie and good liking: By doing whereof (beſides the ſingular fauour that your Highneſſe ſhall do me) your Maieſtie ſhall do no leſſe, then is expected of the woonted vertues and bountie of your Royall and magnificent minde.</p>
               <p>With this letter he diſpatched away one of his gentlemen, who comming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King, gaue it him into his owne handes, the which he gratefully receiued, when he knew from whom it came, for he loued this Chriſtian, eſpecially for his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and goodly perſonage: and reading it, he turned his face, and by chaunce eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the Gouernor of <hi>Coyn,</hi> to whom (taking him aſide) he gaue the letter, ſaying vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Read this letter, who read it, and ſeeing what was paſt, by his countenance did manifeſt how much he was grieued in mind. Which thing the King perceiuing, ſaid vnto him. Be not offended, nor ſorrie, although thou haſt good cauſe; for there is not any reaſonable thing, that the noble Gouernor of
<hi>Alora</hi> requeſteth at my hands (if it lies in my power) which I will not doe for him. And therefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund thee by deferring no time, preſently to goe to <hi>Alora,</hi> and to pardon thy daughter and ſon in law, and carrie them with thee to thy Caſtle; in recompence whereof I will not forget to beſtow on thee continuall fauours. It greeued the old
<hi>Moore</hi> to the verie hart, when he vnderſtood of this euent; but ſeeing he muſt not diſobey the Kings commaund, by counterfeiting a merie countenance, and borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing a little courage of his daunted ſpirits, as wel as he could, he ſaid That he would do it. The Gouernor of <hi>Corn</hi> departed from the Court in all haſte, and came to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lora,</hi> where (vnderſtanding by the way of the Gouernors Gentleman that went with
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23115:66"/>him, all that had paſſed in this aduenture) he was curteouſly receiued: The <hi>Abencer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raje</hi> and his daughter teynted and appalled with ſhame and feare came before him, and kiſſed his hands, who receiuing them ioyfully, ſaid vnto them. I come not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of mine owne accord to repeate, nor entreat of things paſt, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the King, who willed me to pardon your miſdeeds, and your ſudden marriage without my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent. And as for the reſt daughter, thou haſt choſen a better husband for thy ſelfe, then I could haue giuen thee. <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaez</hi> was very glad to heare this gentle greeting of the olde
<hi>Moore,</hi> for whoſe entertainment he made many feaſtes and banquets. And one day when diner was done, he ſaid vnto them. I am not ſo glad, as proud, that I haue beene ſome part and meanes, whereby theſe occurrents are brought to ſo good a paſſe; in proofe whereof, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe could make me more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, for the ranſome of your impriſonment, I will haue but onely the honour, that I haue enioyed by getting and keeping ſuch braue priſoners. Wherefore <hi>Abyndaraes,</hi> thou art free, in teſtimonie whereof I giue thee leaue to goe whither it pleaſe thee, and whenſoeuer thou wilt. He humbly thanked him, and ſo they prepared themſelues to bee gone the next day, when <hi>Rodrigo</hi> of
<hi>Naruaez</hi> bearing them company, they went from <hi>Alora,</hi> and came to <hi>Coyn,</hi> where great triumphes, banquets, and feaſts were made in publicke celebration of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: The which being paſt, their father taking them both one day aſide, ſpake theſe words vnto them. Now that you are (my beloued ſonne and daughter) poſſeſſours of my riches, and liue in reſt, it is not reaſon that you forget the manifolde good turnes done you by the Gouernor of <hi>Alora,</hi> for which you are yet indebted vnto him; and it ſtands not with our honors, for vſing you with ſuch great virtue and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, that he ſhould leefe the right of your ranſome, which ſhould be rather (if you confider the matter well) more then ordinarie. I will giue you fower thouſand double duckats, ſend them vnto him, and behold them here, which he well deſerues (as a friend indeed) though there be different lawes betweene you and him. The <hi>Abencerraje</hi> thanked him verie humbly, and taking them, ſent them in a little rich coffer to
<hi>Rodrigo</hi> of <hi>Naruaez.</hi> And becauſe he would not of his own part ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnthankfull, he ſent him there with all ſixe faire Barbary horſes with rich ſaddles &amp; furniture, and ſixe targets, and launces, the bars and punches being of fine golde. Faire <hi>Xarifa</hi> wrote a ſweete and louing letter vnto him, wherein ſhe gaue him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thankes for the benefits ſhe had receiued by his meanes, and for the gentle entertainment ſhe had in his Caſtle. And willing to ſhew her ſelfe as liberall and thankefull as the reſt, ſhe ſent him a ſweete Cypreſſe cheſt, finely wrought and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for a preſent, and within it moſt curious and coſtly white garmentes for his owne perſon. The valiant Gouernor accepting the preſents, with great thankes to them that ſent them, gaue the horſes, targets, and launces incontinently amongeſt the gentlemen that did accompanie him that night in the skirmiſh, taking the beſt of each, and alſo the Cyprſſe cheſt, with that which faire <hi>Xarifa</hi> had ſent him for himſelfe, and returning the fower thouſand double peeces to the meſſenger againe, he ſaide vnto him. Tell thy Lady
<hi>Xarifa,</hi> that I receiue the Duckets for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes raunſome, and (to doe her ſeruice) ſende them backe againe, towardes the charges of her marriage, and, that for her friendſhip and ſweete ſake, I woulde change all the intereſts that I haue in the world, in lieue that ſhe would make an account of this Caſtell, as her owne, and her husbandes alſo. The meſſenger retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned backe to <hi>Coyn,</hi> where he was well receiued, and the liberalitie of the noble Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of euery one highly commended, whoſe linage doth continue in flouriſhing <pb n="123" facs="tcp:23115:66"/>eſtate to this day in <hi>Antiquera,</hi> equiualent in Heroicall and Martiall deedes with the firſt originall, from whence they are deſcended. The hiſtorie being ended, <hi>Felicia</hi> did commend the grace, and good wordes wherewith faire
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> did tell it, and ſo did all the reſt, that were preient, who taking their leaue of the ſage Lady, went all to take their reſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next day in the morning the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> roſe vp, and went to <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> chamber, whom ſhe found, not with few teares, newly making an end of apparelling her-ſelfe, thinking euery hower ſhe ſtaied there a thouſand yeeres. And the ſage Lady taking her by the hande, they went into a gallerie that looked into a garden, where they had ſupped the night before, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing asked her the cauſe of her teares, and giuing her ſom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſured hope, that her greefes ſhould haue ſuch an end, as ſhe her-ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, ſhe ſaide vnto her. There is nothing in the world more ready to take her life away, whom I loue well, then with incertaine hope to depriue her of the remedie of her greefe, for there is not an hower that ſeemes not ſo long vnto her (liuing in this ſort) as ſhe thinkes the howers of her life ſhort and ſpeedie. Becauſe therefore my deſire is to fulfill thine, and after ſome fewe troubles to haue thee obtaine the ſweet content and reſt, that Fortune hath promiſed thee, thou ſhalt depart from thine owne houſe heere, in the ſame habite that thou cameſt, when thou didſt defend my Nymphes from the force and violence of the brutiſh and cruell Sauages; aſſuring thee beſides, that when my helpe and fauour may ſtande thee in ſteede, vnſent for, thou ſhalt alwaies haue it. So that thy departure faire
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> muſt be preſently; &amp; truſt in God, that thy deſire ſhall haue a happie end: For if I knew it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, thou maiſt well thinke, I woulde not be without other remedies to make thee forget theſe thoughts, as I haue done to many other Louers more.
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> was glad to heare the graue Ladies wordes, to whom ſhe replied thus. I know not howe with words (diſcreete Lady) I may giue you condigne thankes, nor with what deeds and humble ſeruice make any part of ſatisfaction of this infinite fauour, which I receiue at your Ladiſhips hands. God grant I may liue ſo long, that by proofe your Ladiſhippe may know the great deſire I haue to do you all the ſeruice I may. That which your Ladiſhip commands me to do, I will preſently go about, which cannot but haue good ſucceſſe, being directed by her counſell, that can in euery thing giue the beſt. The ſage Lady embraced her, ſaying. I hope to ſee thee, faire <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> in this houſe more loyfull and contented, then now thou art. And bicauſe the two Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes are ſtaying for vs, it is reaſon that I go, to giue them alſo ſome remedy for their ſorrowes, that need it ſo much. Wherefore both of them going out of the hall, and finding <hi>Syrenus</hi> and
<hi>Syluanus, Seluagia</hi> and <hi>Beliſa</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their comming, the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide to <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> Entertaine this company faire Lady, while I come hither againe: and going into a chamber, it was not long before ſhe came out againe with two cruets of fine criſtall in either hande the feete <pb n="124" facs="tcp:23115:67"/>of them being of beaten golde, and curiouſly wrought and enameled: And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſhe ſaide vnto him. If there were any other remedy for thy greefe (forgotten Shepherd) but this, I woulde with all poſſible diligence haue ſought it out, but becauſe thou canſt not now enioy her, who loued thee once ſo well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anothers death, which is onely in the handes of God, of neceſſitie then thou muſt embrace another remedie, to auoide the deſire of an impoſſible thing. And take thou, faire <hi>Seluagia,</hi> and deſpiſed <hi>Syluanus,</hi> this glaſſe, wherein you ſhall finde a ſoueraine remedie for all your ſorrowes paſt &amp; preſent; and a beginning of a ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and contented life, whereof you do now ſo little imagine. And taking the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall cruet, which ſhe helde in her left hande, ſhe gaue it to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and badde him drinke; and <hi>Syrenus</hi> did ſo; and <hi>Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> drunke off the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and in that inſtant they fell all downe to the ground in a deepe ſleepe, which made <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and <hi>Beliſa</hi> not a little to woonder, to whom the ſage Ladie ſaid. Diſcomfort not thy ſelfe <hi>Beliſa,</hi> for I hope in time to ſee thee as glad, as euer any was after their many ſorrowes and paines. And vntill thy angrie fortune be not pleaſed to giue thee a needfull remedy for thy great greefes, my pleaſure is, that thou ſtill remaine heere in my companie. The Shepherdeſſe woulde haue kiſſed her hands at theſe words, but
<hi>Felicia</hi> did not let her, but did rather imbrace her, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how greatly ſhe loued her. But <hi>Feliſmena</hi> ſtanding halfe amazed at the deepe ſleepe of the Shepherdes, ſaide to <hi>Felicia:</hi> If the eaſe of theſe Shepherds (good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) conſiſteth in ſleeping (me thinkes) they haue it in ſo ample ſort, that they may liue the moſt quiet life in the worlde. Woonder not at this (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) for the water they drunke hath ſuch force, that, as long as I will, they ſhall ſleepe ſo ſtrongly, that none may be able to awake them. And becauſe thou maiſt ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no, call one of them as loude as thou canſt. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> then came to <hi>Syluanus,</hi> and pulling him by the arme, began to call him aloud, which did profite her as little, as if ſhe had ſpoken to a dead body; and ſo it was with <hi>Syrenus</hi> and
<hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia,</hi> whereat <hi>Feliſmena</hi> maruelled very much. And then
<hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide vnto her. Nay, thou ſhalt maruell yet more, after they awake, bicauſe thou ſhalt ſee ſo ſtrange a thing, as thou didſt neuer imagine the like. And becauſe the water hath by this time wrought thoſe operations, that it ſhoulde do, I will awake them, and marke it well, for thou ſhalt heare and ſee woonders. Whereupon taking a booke out of her boſome, ſhe came to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and ſmiting him vpon the head with it, the Shepherd roſe vp on his ſeete in his perfect wits and iudgement: To whom <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide. Tell me <hi>Syrenus,</hi> if thou mighteſt now ſee faire <hi>Diana,</hi> &amp; her vnworthy husband both togither in all the contentment and ioy of the worlde, laughing at thy loue, and making a ſport of thy teares and ſighes, what wouldeſt thou do? Not greeue me a whit (good Lady) but rather helpe them to laugh at my follies paſt. But if ſhe were now a maide againe, (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) or perhaps a widow, and would be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Syluanus</hi> and not to thee, what wouldſt thou then do? My ſelfe woulde be the man (ſaide
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) that woulde gladly helpe to make ſuch a match for my friende. What thinkeſt thou of this <hi>Feliſmena</hi> (ſaide
<hi>Felicia</hi>) that water is able to vnlooſe the knottes that peruerſe Loue doth make? I woulde neuer haue thought (ſaide <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) that anie humane skill coulde euer attaine to ſuch diuine knowledge as this. And looking on <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſhe ſaide vnto him. Howe nowe
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> what meanes this? Are the teares and ſighes whereby thou didſt manifeſt thy loue and greefe, ſo ſoone ended? Since my loue is nowe ended (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) no maruell then, if the effects proceeding from it be alſo determined. <pb n="125" facs="tcp:23115:67"/>And is it poſſible now (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) that thou wilt loue <hi>Diana</hi> no more? I wiſh her as much good (anſwered <hi>Syrenus</hi>) as I doe to your owne ſelfe (faire Lady) or to any other woman that neuer offended me. But
<hi>Felicia,</hi> ſeeing how <hi>Feliſmena</hi> was amazed at the ſudden alteration of <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſaid. With this medicine I would alſo cure thy greefe (faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) and thine <hi>Beliſa,</hi> if fortune did not deferre them to ſome greater content, then onely to enioy your libertie. And bicauſe thou maiſt ſee how diuerſly the medicines haue wrought in <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia,</hi> it ſhall not be amiſſe to awake them, for now they haue ſlept ynough: wherefore laying her booke vpon <hi>Syluanus</hi> his head, he roſe vp, ſaying. O faire
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> what a great offence and folly haue I committed, by imploying my thoughtes vpon another, after that mine eies did once behold thy rare beautie? What meanes this <hi>Syluanus</hi> (ſaid <hi>Felicia.</hi>) No woman in the world euen now in thy mouth, but thy Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Diana,</hi> and now ſo ſuddenly changed to <hi>Seluagia? Syluanus</hi> anſwering her, ſaid. As the ſhip (diſcreete Lady) ſailes floting vp and downe, and well-ny caſt away in the vnknowen ſeas, without hope of a ſecure hauen: ſo did my thoughtes (putting my life in no ſinall hazard) wander in <hi>Dianas</hi> loue, all the while, that I purſued it. But now ſince I am ſafely arriued into a hauen, of all ioy and happineſſe, I onely wiſh I may haue har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and entertainment there, where my irremooueable and infinite loue is ſo firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> was as much aſtoniſhed at the ſecond kinde of alteration of
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> as at that firſt of <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and therefore ſaide vnto him laughing. What doſt thou <hi>Syluanus?</hi> Why doſt thou not awake <hi>Seluagia?</hi> for ill may a Shepherdeſſe heare thee, that is ſo faſt aſleepe. <hi>Syluanus</hi> then pulling her by the arme, began to ſpeake out aloud vnto her, ſaying. Awake faire <hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſince thou haſt awaked my thoughtes out of the drowſie ſlumber of paſſed ignorance. Thriſe happy man, whom fortune hath put in the happieſt eſtate that I could deſire. What doſt thou meane faire Shepherdeſſe, doſt thou not heare me, or wilt thou not anſwere me? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the impatient paſſion of the loue I beare thee, will not ſuffer me to be vnheard. O my
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſleepe not ſo much, and let not thy ſlumber be an occaſion to make the ſleepe of death put out my vitall lightes. And ſeeing how little it auailed him, by calling her, he began to powre foorth ſuch abundance of teares, that they, that were preſent, could not but weepe alſo for tender compaſſion: whereupon <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide vnto him. Trouble not thy ſelfe <hi>Syluanus,</hi> for as I will make <hi>Seluagia</hi> anſwere thee, ſo ſhall not her anſwere be contrarie to thy deſire, and taking him by the hand, ſhe led him into a chamber, and ſaid vnto him. Depart not from hence, vntill I call thee; and then ſhe went to the place againe where <hi>Seluagia</hi> lay, and touching her with her booke, awaked her, as ſhe had done the reſt, and ſaide vnto her. Me thinks thou haſt ſlept ſecurely Shepherdeſſe. O good Lady (ſaid ſhe) where is my
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> was he not with me heere? O God, who hath carried him away from hence? or wil he come hither againe? Harke to me <hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſaid
<hi>Felicia,</hi> for me thinkes thou art not wel in thy wits. Thy beloued
<hi>Alanius</hi> is without, &amp; ſaith that he hath gone wandring vp and downe in many places ſeeking after thee, and hath got his fathers good will to marrie thee: which ſhall as little auaile him (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) as the ſighes and teares which once in vaine I powred out, and ſpent for him, for his memorie is now exiled out of my thoughts. <hi>Syluanus</hi> mine onely life and ioy, O <hi>Syluanus</hi> is he, whom I loue. O what is become of my <hi>Syluanus?</hi> Where is my <hi>Syluanus?</hi> Who hearing the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe <hi>Seluagia</hi> no ſooner name him, could ſtay no longer in the chamber, but came running into the hall vnto her, where the one beheld the other with ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraunt ſignes of cordiall affection, and ſo ſtrongly confirmed by the mutual bonds <pb n="126" facs="tcp:23115:68"/>of their knowen deſerts, that nothing but death was able to diſſolue it; whereat
<hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus, Feliſmena,</hi> and the Shepherdeſſe were paſſing ioyfull. And <hi>Felioia</hi> ſeeing them all in this contentment, ſaid vnto them. Now is it time for you Shepherds, and faire Shepherdeſſe to goe home to your flocks, which would be glad to heare the wonted voice of their knowen maſters: And make this account, that you ſhall neuer want any helpe and fauour at her handes, who is ſoready to pleaſure you in what ſhee may. And the holy end <hi>(Syluanus)</hi> and conſummation of thy loue ſhall be, when with her, whom thou doſt ſo deerly loue, thou ſhalt combine thy ſelfe in the ſacred bonds of chaſte and lawfull mariage, whereof I will be carefull to put you both in minde, when time &amp; opportunitie ſhal ſerue. And (faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) prepare thy ſelfe alſo for thy departure, for to morrow is the day, wherein it behooues thee to go from hence. After this, all the Nymphes came in at the hall doore, who now knew of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that their gracious Ladie had giuen the Shepherds for their griefes, which thing made them not a little glad,
<hi>Doria</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Cynthia</hi> and <hi>Polydora,</hi> bicauſe they were the principall occaſions of their content. The two new louers did buſie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in nothing elſe, but in looking vpon one another with ſuch affection and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes, as if a thouſand yeeres had bin paſt ſince their loues had firſt begon between them. And that day they all taried there, with as great ioy and pleaſure, as by ſuch a new commenced loue might be imagined, vntil the next day in the morning, when the two Shepherds and the Shepherdeſſe, taking their leaue of the ſage Ladie
<hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> and of <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and <hi>Beliſa,</hi> and likewiſe of all the Nymphes, with great ioy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their villages, whither they came the verie ſame day. And faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> (who had that day put on againe her Shepherdeſſes weeds) taking her leaue of the ſage Ladie, and being particularly and well aduiſed what to doe, with many teares embraced her, and, accompanied of all thoſe Nymphes, went forth into the great Court before the Palace gate, where embracing euerie one by her ſelfe, ſhee went that way that they did direct her. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> went not alone, neither did her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions giue her leaue ſo to do: for on the one ſide ſhe went thinking of that, which the wiſe Ladie had told her; and conſidering on the other, what little hap and leſſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, ſhe had yet in her loue, which made her doubt of her future happines. With theſe contrarieties of thoughts did ſhe go warring in her minde, which though on the one ſide they made her wearie; yet on the other they did entertaine her with their company, ſo that in the meane time ſhe forgot her ſolitarie and painefull way. She had not trauelled far in the mids of a faire valley, when towardes the weſt part therof, ſhe eſpied a far off a Shepherds coat, which, at the entrance of a green wood ſtood, amongſt many high Okes, and inuited thither by her importunate hunger and wearines, and alſo bicauſe the heate of the day began to come on ſo faſt, that ſhee was forced to paſſe it away vnder the ſhadow of thoſe braunchie trees, ſhe bended her ſteps directly towards it. Comming to the coate, ſhe heard how a Shepherd ſaid vnto a Shepherdeſſe, that ſat neere vnto him, theſe wordes. Entreate me not, good <hi>Amarillis,</hi> to ſing, ſince thou knoweſt what great cauſes I haue to ſigh, and weepe all the dayes, whileſt my languiſhing ſoule ſhall not forſake this wearied and fainte bodie. For though muſicke is no ſmall meanes to encreaſe his melancholie, that is euer ſadde and penſiue, as his ioye and mirthe, whoe liues a merry life; yet my greefe is not of ſuch a qualitie, that by any humane arte or induſtrie may be increaſed or diminiſhed. Heere haſt thou thy baggepipe, play and ſing, faire Shepherdeſſe, for well maiſt thou do it, hauing thy hart as free, as thy wil exempt from the bondage of loue. Then the Shepherdeſſe anſwered him againe. <pb n="127" facs="tcp:23115:68"/>Be not ſuch a niggard of thy skill, <hi>Arſileus,</hi> which the heauens and nature haue ſo bountifully beſtowed on thee: for, ſhe that doth aske it at thy hands, will not denie to pleaſure thee in any thing ſhe may. Sing if it be poſſible that ſong, which (at the requeſt of <hi>Argaſtus</hi>) thou didſt make in the name of thy father <hi>Arſenius,</hi> when, for hir loue, you both ſerued and ſued to the faire Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Beliſa.</hi> Thy condition is ſtrange <hi>Amarillis</hi> (ſaide the Shepherd againe) ſtill demanding that of me, which doth leaſt of all content me. What ſhall I do, for perforce I muſt pleaſe thee, and yet not perforce, ſince he were very diſcourteous (to ſay the truth) that would not of his own accord do thee any ſeruice he could. But now thou ſeeſt, how my ill fortune doth euer narrowly purſue me, when I woulde faine take ſome ſmall reſpite, and eaſe from my greeuous thoughts. And ſeeing the great reaſon I haue <hi>(Amarillis)</hi> to burſt out in continuall lamentations and teares, why doſt thou then command me to ſing? What pleaſure doſt thou take to offende the occaſions of my ſorrowe? I pray God thou maiſt neuer haue the like, to feele the greefe that I do, bicauſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune might not (ſo greatly to thy coſt) informe thee of my paine. Thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt well enough I haue loſt my <hi>Beliſa,</hi> and that I liue without hope of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie. Why doſt thou then commaund me to ſing? But ſince I will not haue thee conceiue an opinion of me to be diſcourteous (for it was neuer my manner and condition to be accounted ſo amongſt faire Shepherdeſſes, to whom we Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes, and my ſelfe eſpecially for my
<hi>Beliſas</hi> ſake, owe all reſpect of loue and dutie, and are ſo much beholding) I will endeuour (though moſt againſt my minde) to content thee: Whereupon taking vp his Rebecke that lay hard by him, he began to tune it, and doe that, which the Shepherdeſſe requeſted him.
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> that was liſtening to their talke, might heare very well what ſpeeches paſſed betweene them; And when ſhe ſawe they talked of <hi>Arſenius,</hi> and <hi>Arſileus,</hi> ſeruants to faire
<hi>Beliſa,</hi> (both which ſhe tooke to be long ſince dead, as
<hi>Beliſa</hi> had told, not only her, but the Nymphes alſo, &amp; the Shepherds, when they found her in the Shepherds coat in the Iland) ſhe verily thought, that all, that ſhe heard, and ſawe there, was but a meere dreame, or ſome fantaſtick illuſion. But giuing attentiue eare, ſhe perceiued how the Shepherd began to touch his Rebecke ſo diuinely, that ſhe thought it to be ſome celeſtiall muſicke, who hauing plaide on it a little with a more heauenly then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane voice, began to ſing this ſong following.</p>

               <p>This did the Shepherd ſing, keeping time with his teares, and reſting with his ſighes, and the Shepherdeſſe ſat harkening vnto him with great content, to ſee with what a grace he did both play and ſing. But after the Shepherd had made an end of his ſong, laying his rebecke out of his hand, he ſaid to Shepherdeſſe. Art thou now pleaſed <hi>Amarillis,</hi> for (to content thy minde) thou maiſt make me do that, which doth vtterly diſpleaſe me. And accurſed <hi>Alfeus,</hi> I wiſh that Fortune would bring thee to that paſſe, wherunto by thy deteſted forceries I am come, bicauſe thou mighteſt then know what good cauſe I haue to hate thee, for the cruell deſpite that thou haſt done me. O ſweet <hi>Beliſa,</hi> is there any in the world more bound to thee then I am? God graunt I may deduct this ſorrowfull life ſo long, that mine eies may once again enioy thy peerleſſe beautie, &amp; that thine may ſee, if I do not acknowledge, how much I do owe vnto them. Theſe words the Shepherd ſpake with ſuch plentie of teares, that there was no hart (had it beene neuer ſo hard) that by hearing them, would not haue melted. But now that thou haſt told me
<hi>Arſileus</hi> (ſaid the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe vnto him) the beginning of thy affection, and how thy father <hi>Arſenius</hi> was the principall occaſion of thy ſeruice and great loue to <hi>Beliſa;</hi> bicauſe when he ſued vnto her, ſhe did participate, and thou profit thy ſelfe by thine owne letters &amp; ſongs, and ſome times by thine owne muſicke, (of all which he might haue well excuſed himſelfe) I pray thee now tell me, how thou didſt leeſe her. This is a thing (ſaid the Shepherd) which I would ſeldome repeat, but bicauſe it is euer thy qualitie, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me to tell thee that, which is moſt grieuous vnto my ſoule, hearke then, and in a few words I will tell it thee.</p>
               <p>There was a man in our towne called <hi>Alfeus,</hi> who had the name amongſt vs to be a great Magician, and he loued <hi>Beliſa</hi> extremely, before my Father euer began to ſerue her, but ſhe could not abide, not onely to ſee him, but not to heare of his <pb n="130" facs="tcp:23115:70"/>name, which if any had but founded in her eares, they could not haue angred her worſe. Now when this Coniurer vnderſtood (I know not how) of the appointed meeting betweene me and <hi>Beliſa,</hi> to talke together in the night from the toppe of a Mulberie tree in her fathers Orchard;
<hi>Alfeus,</hi> full of diuels, commanded two ſpirits to take the ſhape of my father <hi>Arſenius,</hi> &amp; mine vpon them, &amp; that he, that took vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him my ſhape, ſhuld go to the appointed place; &amp; the other, that took my fathers, ſhould come thither, &amp; ſhoot at him in the tree with a crosbow arrowe, thinking he was not his Son, but another, &amp; then to come preſently vnto him, &amp; knowing him to be his Son, ſhould kill himſelfe, for greefe that he had ſtaine his owne Son, to the end that the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Beliſa</hi> ſhould kill her-ſelfe, ſeeing my ſelfe &amp; my Father dead, or at leaſt do that, which afterwards ſhe did. This villany did the traitor <hi>Alfeus</hi> work, for deſpight of that great loue, which he knew <hi>Beliſa</hi> did beare me; and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which ſhe had of his vnwoorthy affection. When this was in maner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide done, and <hi>Beliſa</hi> thought that my Father and I were both ſtaine, like a careles and deſperate woman, ſhe forſooke her Fathers houſe, and is gone where none can yet tel where ſhe is, or any tydings of her. This did the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Armida</hi> tel me, and I do verily beleeue it, according to that which ſucceeded after. When
<hi>Feliſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> had heard what the Shepherd had tolde <hi>Amarillis,</hi> ſhe wondred not a little, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining with her-ſelfe, that all that he tolde, did ſeeme to be true, and by the ſignes that ſhe ſawe in him, knewe that he was the ſame <hi>Arſileus, Beliſas</hi> ſeruant, whom ſhe thought to be dead, and therefore ſaide to her-ſelfe. It is not reaſon, that Fortune ſhould giue her any content, that would denie it a Shepherd, that doth ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, and that ſtands ſo much in neede thereof. I will not at the leaſt, depart from this place, without giuing him ſuch ioy, as he will receiue at the newes of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Shepherdeſſe. Whereupon comming to the dore of the coate, ſhe ſaide to
<hi>Amarillis.</hi> Will it pleaſe thee (faire Shepherdeſſe) to giue the forlorne woman of Fortune, that hath loſt her way, and the hope to finde it out againe, leaue to paſſe away the heate of the day in this place with thee? The Shepherdeſſe ſeeing on a ſudden ſuch exceeding beautie, and ſo comely a feature, was ſo amazed, that ſhe was vnable to anſwer one worde againe: but <hi>Arſileus</hi> ſaide vnto her. There wants no other thing (faire Shepherdeſſe) for the performing of thy requeſt, but the place, which is not ſo good as thou deſerueſt: but if thou art wont to bee ſerued with ſuch homely lodging, Come in, and wherein wee may doe thee any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, our good wils ſhall excuſe the wants of our abilitie. Theſe wordes <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> (ſaide <hi>Feliſmena</hi> againe) ſeeme well to come out of thy mouth, but the ioye, that I will leaue with thee in requitall of them, I wiſh may befall to me of that, which I haue ſo long deſired. And ſaying thus, ſhe went into the Coate, and the Shepherd and Shepherdeſſe roſe vppe, offering her their places, and all three ſitting downe againe, <hi>Arſileus</hi> ſaide to <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> Haue you euer ſeene mee before (faire Shepherdeſſe,) or hath any body tolde you of my name? I knowe more of thee <hi>Arſileus</hi> (ſaide
<hi>Feliſmena</hi>) and of thy eſtate, then thou thinkeſt, although thou art in a Shepherdes weede, far different from that I ſawe thee in, when thou wert a ſtudent in the famous Academie of <hi>Salamanca:</hi> If there be any thing heere to eate, I pray thee giue it me, for I will tell thee afterwardes a ſtrange and true thing, which thou haſt deſired long ſince to knowe. This will I doe with a good will (ſaide <hi>Arſileus</hi>) though I can doe no kinde of ſeruice, due ynough to the great apparance of thy vertues and deſerts. Whereupon <hi>Arſileus</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> taking of their ſeuerallſcrips, gaue <hi>Feliſmena</hi> ſuch victuals, as they had. And after ſhe had <pb n="131" facs="tcp:23115:70"/>refreſhed her ſelfe, deſirous to make him a ioyfull man, who liued ſo long a time in greefe and ſorrow, ſhe began to ſpeake to him in this ſort. There is nothing in the world <hi>(Arſileus)</hi> that ought more religiouſly to be kept then firmneſſe, and moſt of all in a womans hart where it is ſeldomer wont to be found. But the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I plainly perceiue, that men for the moſt part are occaſions of their ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie towardes them. I ſpeake this for the greatbond wherein thou art obliged to a Shepherdeſſe, that I knowe, who would not (if ſhe knew thou wert aliue) exchange her ioy and content for all that the whole world could affoord. And then ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to tell him in order all that was paſt, from the time that ſhe killed the three Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uages, vntill ſhe came to the Lady <hi>Felicias</hi> houſe: In which diſcourſe <hi>Arſileus</hi> heard the golden newes of the thing, which he ſo deerely loued, and all that had paſſed betweene her and the Nymphes, when they found her ſleeping in the <hi>Iland of the Lake,</hi> as you haue heard before: And that ioie, which he then felt, when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the loue and faith which his Shepherdeſſe did beare him, remained yet ſincere, and inuiolate in her hart, and the place certaine, where he might finde her out, was ſo extreme, that he fell downe in a traunce betweene them both, by putting his life in hazard, with ſurfeit of that ſudden paſſion: But comming to himſelfe againe, he ſaid to
<hi>Feliſmena.</hi> With what wordes ſhall I ſufficiently (faire Shepherdeſſe) thanke thee for the great curteſie thou haſt done me, and with what deedes acquite that ſingular content, wherewith thou haſt now bleſſed me, the like whereof I pray God ſo amply in euery thing may giue thee, as thy hart can either wiſh or deſire. O my ſweete
<hi>Beliſa,</hi> is it poſſible that I ſhall ſee thoſe eies ſo ſoone againe, that had ſo great power ouer mine, to kiſſe thoſe delicate hands, that made ſo intricate a knot in my hart, to heare thoſe angelicall words, and ſee that ſingular beauty, that rauiſhed ſo much my admiring ſenſes. And that after ſo many troubles of minde, and turmoiles of Fortune, ſuch ſoueraine felicitie to ſucceede in their places? And ſpeaking this with many teares, he tooke <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> hands, and with great reuerence kiſſed them. And ſo did the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Amarillis,</hi> ſaying. Thou haſt reuiued (faire Shepherdeſſe) the moſt ſorrowfull man that euer I did ſee, and filled him full of ioye, who did leſt deſerue to haue it. Sixe monethes hath
<hi>Arſileus</hi> liued in this Cotage ſo ſorrowfull and deſolate a life, as none coulde imagine the like, without all manner of conſolation, but that cortaine Shepherdeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſeeding their flockes in theſe plaines (of the which I am one) ſometimes come in to viſite him, and to affoord him that comfort, which his greefe (were it at the leſt capable of any at all, woulde giue him leaue to embrace. This is not ſuch a greefe (ſaide
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> againe) that he, that hath it, may thinke to take any comfort in any thing, but in the firſt cauſer thereof, or by whom he heareth ſuch newes, as I haue now tolde him: which are ſo good for me (faire Shepherdeſſe) ſaide <hi>Arſileus,</hi> that they haue reuiued a liuing hart in me, which was mortified and worne almoſT out with the clogge of continual care. So much did the Shepherds words &amp; teares, vttered and powred foorth for ioy, mollifie her tender hart, as by her owne, ſhe gaue manifeſt proofe thereof. And in this ſort they tarried there, vntill the heate of the day was paſt; and then <hi>Arſileus,</hi> taking his leaue with great thankes to both the Shepherdeſſes, with infinite ioy went towards the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> the ſame way that <hi>Feliſmena</hi> did direct him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> with that content, as they are wont to haue, which after a long abſence, enioy the ſight of their deſired Loue, did goe towardes the pleaſant meadowes, where their flockes went feeding in companie of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde <pb n="132" facs="tcp:23115:71"/>
                  <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who went alſo free and deliuered from that kinde of content, that hee behelde in them, and from the paine, which the want thereof is wont to procure; bicauſe hee neither thought of louing well, nor cared, whether he was beloued or no? Whereupon <hi>Syluanus</hi> ſaid vnto him. Euerie time that I ſee thee (my deere friend <hi>Syrenus</hi>) thou ſhouldeſt not be the man (me thinkes) that thou wert wont to be, but that iointly with thy former thoughts and affection, thou art thy ſelfe alſo chaunged: On the one ſide, I haue in a manner pitie of thee; on the other, it greeues me not to ſee thee careleſſe of loues misfortunes. In what reſpect (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) haſt thou pitie on me? Bicauſe I thinke it (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) the moſt malecontent and worſt eſtate of life, not to loue well, nor to be beloued againe. It is not long ſince that thou didſt vnderſtand this cleane contrarie (ſaid <hi>Syrenus.</hi>) And for mine owne part, I pray God that Fortune may ſtill preſerue me in this ill eſtate, and thee in that ioy &amp; pleaſure which thou takeſt in ſeeing thy <hi>Seluagia.</hi> For though there might ariſe ſome emulation of thy loue, and being beloued of ſo faire a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe; yet can I aſſure thee, that Fortune doth not neglect to tune you the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that you receiue of your mutuall loue. The hurt, ſaid <hi>Seluagia,</hi> that ſhe may doe vs with her diſordinate effects, can neuer be ſo great, as my ioy is to ſee my ſelfe ſo well beſtowed. Ah <hi>Seluagia</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi> to her) I haue alſo ſeene my ſelfe as well beloued, as none might be more, and thought as little to ſee an end of my loue, as you do now: but let none account without Fortune, nor lay his foundation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſideration of the mutabilitie of time. But I doe owe no ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of loue and duetie to the ſage Ladie <hi>Felicia,</hi> whom the heauens requite: For I neuer imagined to ſpeake ſo freely of mine ill in ſuch a time, when I thought to feele it ſo little. But I am more indebted to her (ſaide <hi>Seluagia</hi>) bicauſe ſhee was the cauſe, that I loued him well, whoſe ſight I euer enioyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eies: But <hi>Syluanus</hi> turning his eies to her, ſaide. This debt I ſhoulde with great reaſon (my life) requite, if it were ſuch a thing, that might with life bee paied, which God grant thee (ſaide <hi>Seluagia</hi>) ſince without the ſame mine ſhoulde be woorſe then a continuall death. <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſeeing the amorous words on both ſides, with a ſmiling countenance ſaide vnto them. It is well that euery one can ſo well acquite himſelfe for his good turne done him, that the one will neither be in debt, nor the other haue any indebted to him; and yet in mine owne opinion it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that you reioyce ſo much, and ſo louingly entreate of your amorous affections, my ſelfe not being a thirde in them. With theſe and other ſpeeches the newe Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and careleſſe <hi>Syrenus</hi> paſſed away the time and length of the way, which they made an end of about ſunne ſet: And before they came to the fountaine of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camours, they heard a voice of a Shepherdeſſe ſweetely ſinging, whom they knew by and by, for <hi>Syluanus</hi> hearing her ſaide vnto them. This is <hi>Diana</hi> doubtleſſe, that ſinges at the fountaine of the Sicamours. It is ſhe indeede (ſaid <hi>Seluagia.</hi>) Let vs go behinde theſe Myrtle trees neere vnto her, bicauſe we may heare her the better. Agreed ſaide <hi>Syrenus,</hi> although the time hath beene, when her muſicke and ſight delighted me more then now. But all three going into the thicket of Myrtle trees, and bicauſe it was about the going down of the Sunne, they ſawe faire <hi>Diana</hi> neere to the fountaine, ſhining with ſuch ſurpaſſing beautie, that they ſtoode (as men that had neuer ſeene her before) amazed and in a woonder. Her haire hung downe looſe from her head behinde, and gathered vp with a carnation ſtringe, which parted them in the middes: her eies were fixed on the ground, and ſomtimes looking into the cleere fountaine, and wiping away ſome teares, that nowe and then trickled downe her beautifull cheekes, ſhe ſung this Dittie.</p>

               <p>The time was once, when <hi>Dianas</hi> teares and dolefull ſong and the ſorrow, that by her ſadde lookes ſhe expreſſed, might haue ſo much mooued <hi>Syrenus</hi> hart, as put the Shepherdes life in ſuch danger, that all other remedies (but onely proceeding from the ſame) had beene impoſſible to haue helpt it; whoſe eies and hart, ſince now they were deliuered out of that dangerous priſon, tooke no delight to beholde
<hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> nor greeued at her ſorrowfull lamentations. And the Shepherd
<hi>Syluanus</hi> had leſſe cauſe in his minde to be condolent for any greefe that <hi>Diana</hi> had, conſidering ſhe neuer had the ſmalleſt regard of the greateſt woes which he paſſed for her ſake. Onely
<hi>Seluagia</hi> helped her with her teares, fearefull (by the fall of her ioy) of her own fortune, whereupon ſhe ſaid to <hi>Syrenus.</hi> There is no perfection, beautie, nor fauour, in natures gift, which ſhe hath not liberally beſtowed on <hi>Diana,</hi> bicauſe her beautie is peereleſſe, her wit and diſcretion admired, her good graces excellent, and all other her commendable parts, which a Shepherdeſſe ſhould haue, not to be ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: ſince in the leſt of them, that made her ſuch a woonder in our age, there was neuer any yet that excelled her. Onlie one thing ſhe wanted, which I euer ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and feared, and this was her good Fortune, which woulde neuer accompanie her, to haue made her liue a contented and ioyfull life, which (to ſpeake the truth) <pb n="134" facs="tcp:23115:72"/>ſhe euer well deſerued. She that ſo vniuſtly hath taken it from ſo many (ſaide
<hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) by great reaſon ſhould not enioy ſuch a happie eſtate; which I ſpeake not, that I am not ſorrie to ſee this Shepherdeſſe ſo ſorrowful, but for the great reaſon I haue, not to wiſh her any content at all. Saie not ſo (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) for I cannot thinke, that <hi>Diana</hi> hath offended thee in any thing. What offence did ſhe by marrying, compelled thereunto by the conſtraint of her parents, and kinsfolkes, and not by her owne will? And after ſhe was married, what could ſhe do (hauing due regarde to her honor and honeſtie) but forget thee? Truly <hi>Syrenus,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cauſe to complaine of <hi>Diana,</hi> then I haue heard thee hitherto alledge. In truth
<hi>Syrenus</hi> (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) <hi>Seluagia</hi> hath ſo great reaſon for that ſhe ſaith, that none can well diſprooue it. And if there be any that of ingratitude can iuſtly accuſe her, it is I, who loued her more then my ſelfe, ſhe requiting it ſo ill againe, and with ſuch cruell contempt as thou knoweſt well enough. <hi>Seluagia</hi> caſting an amorous eie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, ſaide. But thou didſt not deſerue (my beloued Shepherd) to be ſo ill entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſince there is no Shepherdeſſe in the worlde, that may not thinke her-ſelfe bleſt to enioy thy happy loue. About this time <hi>Diana</hi> perceiued, that their talke was of her, for the Shepherds were ſo loude, that ſhe might heare them very well: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore riſing vp, and looking among the Myrtle trees, ſhe knew the Shepherdes, and the Shepherdeſſe that was ſitting betweene them. Who, perceiuing that ſhe had eſpied them, came to her, and curteouſly ſaluted her, and ſhe them againe with a good grace and countenance, asking them, where they had beene ſo long a time. Whom they anſwered with another kinde of wordes and countenance, then they were wont to do, which ſeemed ſo ſtrange to
<hi>Diana,</hi> that though ſhe tooke no care for any of their loues, yet in the end it greeued her, to ſee them ſo much altered from that they were wont to be, and eſpecially when ſhe perceiued what great ioy
<hi>Sylua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> tooke in beholding faire <hi>Seluagia.</hi> And bicauſe it was now time to go home, and that the flockes tooke their accuſtomed way towards the village, they went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and by the way faire <hi>Diana</hi> ſaide to <hi>Syrenus.</hi> There are many daies paſt, Shepherd, ſince I ſawe thee in theſe valleyes. But more (ſaide he) ſince I woulde haue loſt my life, in lieu ſhe had not ſeene me, that made me paſſe it away in ſuch great greefe, whereas in the end it contents me not a little to talke of my paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, that finde my ſelfe now in a ſafe hauen. Doſt thou then thinke this to be a ſure eſtate, (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) wherein thou now liueſt? It cannot be dangerous (ſaid he) when I dare ſpeake thus before thee. I neuer remember (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) that I ſawe thee ſo much loſt for my loue, but that thy toong might haue had as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, as now it hath. Thou art as diſcreet in imagining this (ſaid he) as in all other things elſe. Why ſo (ſaide <hi>Diana?</hi>) bicauſe there are no other meanes (ſaide he) to make thee not know that, which thou haſt loſt in me, but onely by thinking that I did not loue thee ſo much, that my toong might not haue that libertie, as thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. But yet for all this I pray God giue thee ſo much content as ſometimes (faire
<hi>Diana</hi>) thou haſt wiſhed me: For though my loue be now paſt, yet the relickes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that remaine in my ſoule, are ſufficient to wiſh thee al the happines in the world. Euery word that <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſpake was a dagger to <hi>Dianas</hi> hart. For God knowes, if ſhe would not haue rather giuen a more willing eare to his wonted complaints, then occupied her minde in beleeuing ſuch apparant ſignes of his newe libertie. And though ſhe anſwered to euery thing the Shepherd ſpake vnto her, with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of careleſſenes, and did helpe her-ſelfe by her owne diſcretion (bicauſe ſhe would not ſhew any ſigne of ſorrow for their libertie) yet in her minde ſhe rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated <pb n="135" facs="tcp:23115:72"/>the diſcontent, that by their ſpeeches &amp; ſemblances ſhe had ſo deepely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And with talking of theſe and other matters, they were come to their village by that time the Sunne had hidden all his beames, and taking leaue one of another, they went to their owne houſes.</p>
               <p>But comming to <hi>Arſileus</hi> againe, who went with great ioye and deſire towards the wood where <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple was, to ſee his Shepherdeſſe, he came to a little brooke, that ranne hard by the Temple amongſt a row of greene Sicamours, vnder whoſe coole ſhadowes he ſat him downe, hoping that Fortune would ſend ſome body that way, by whom he might make his <hi>Beliſa</hi> vnderſtand of his being there, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it ſomwhat dangerous to come vpon her on the ſudden, eſpecially when ſhe thought him long ſince to be dead: And on the other ſide, the vnpatient deſire that he had to ſee her, would not ſuffer him to take any reſt at all. But the Shepherd conſulting with himſelfe what was beſt to be done, eſpied by chaunce a Nymph of wonderfull beautie comming towardes him with her bowe in her hand, and her quiuer at her necke, looking on euerie ſide, if ſhe could eſpie any Deare or wilde beaſt, to trie how ſhe could beſtow an arrow, that ſhe carried in her bow ready bent. But ſeeing the Shepherd, ſhe went ſtraight vnto him, who riſing vp, did her ſuch reuerence as was due to ſo faire a Nymph, whom ſhe curteouſly ſaluted againe: For this was faire <hi>Polydora,</hi> one of the three that
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> and the Shepherds deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the violent hands of the Sauages, and a deere friend to <hi>Beliſa.</hi> But both ſitting downe againe vpon the greene graſſe, <hi>Polydora</hi> asked him what countrey man he was, and the cauſe of his comming thither. Whom <hi>Arſileus</hi> anſwered thus. The countrey where I was borne (faire Nymph) hath ſo ill intreated me, that (me thinkes) it greeues me to call it mine, although on the other ſide, I am bound to loue it much, and more then I am able to expreſſe. And to tell thee the cauſe, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had to bring me to this place, it were firſt needefull for thee (faire Nymph) to tell me, if thou doſt belong to the ſage Lady <hi>Felicia,</hi> in whoſe Palace (I heard ſay) my deereſt <hi>Beliſia</hi> doth remaine, the onely cauſe of my exile out of my natiue town, &amp; of that infinit ſorrow, which her long abſence hath made me feel, I am of Lady <hi>Felicias</hi> houſe (ſaid
<hi>Polydora</hi>) &amp; the greteſt friend in the world to the Shepherdeſſe that thou haſt named: and bicauſe thou maiſt alſo make ſuch an account of me, if I thought I might profit thee any thing by giuing thee ſome conſel, I would aduiſe thee to forget hir, if it were poſſible, or (if it lay in thy power) not once to haue an amorous thought of hir, bicauſe the remedie of thy griefe is no leſſe impoſſible, then the helpe of that, which ſhe ſuffers, ſince the cruell ground doth now feede on him, who was once the hope of al her ſorrow. And may this be true (ſaid he) that the earth doth conſume hir ſeruant
<hi>Arſileus?</hi> moſt true (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) for this was he, whom ſhe loued more then her ſelfe, and he, whom I may iuſtly call the moſt vnfortunate man beſides thee, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt ſetled thy thoughts in ſuch a place, where it is impoſſible for them to haue any remedie. For though I was neuer in loue my ſelfe, yet do I hold it for a firme opinion, that the paſſion of death is not ſo ill, as that, which one ſuffers by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, her that hath her affection ſetled in another place. I beleeue it well faire Nymph (ſaid <hi>Arſileus</hi>) and that ſuch are <hi>Beliſas</hi> golden virtues and rare conſtancie, that as imperious death cannot make her ſettle her affection in any other place, ſo there is none in the world, that can make her chaunge her minde, wherein (faire Nymph) the whole ſumme of my felicitie conſiſteth. How doth thy felicitie conſiſt Shepherd (ſaid ſhe) by louing ſo as thou ſaiſt, when as her loue is ſo ſtrongly fixed in another place? This is a ſtrange kinde of affection, and neuer heard of before. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="136" facs="tcp:23115:73"/>thou maiſt no longer (faire Nymph) maruell at my words, nor at the maner of the loue which I beare to <hi>Beliſa</hi> the ſoueraigne miſtreſſe of my thoughts, giue eare a while (ſaid <hi>Arſileus</hi>) and I wil tel thee that, thou neuer thought'ſt to heare, although the beginning of it, thy friend, and the loadſtarre of my life hath perhaps told thee. And then he told her from the beginning of their loues to <hi>Alfeus</hi> his inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and braue deceit, and euerie thing elſe, that till then in his loues aforeſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell vnto him: which the Shepherd told ſometimes with teares, being loth to recall to memorie his paſſed miſhaps; ſometimes with ſighes, that he fetcht from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of his hart, imagining what his miſtreſſe <hi>Beliſa</hi> might feele in theſe occurrents and greeuous accidents. And by his dolefull words and alterations in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, he gaue ſo great a ſpirit to that he ſaid, and ſhewed ſuch ſignes of inwarde griefe, that as it ſtrooke the Nymph in a great admiration, ſo likewiſe in no leſſe compaſſion of his paines: but when ſhe vnderſtood, that vndoubtedly he was <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi> the ioy that ſhe conceiued thereof was ſo great, that with words ſhe could not tell it, and thought her ſelfe vnable at that preſent to do any more, but with inward ſence to ſurfet on the ſweet ioy of ſuch happie newes. Behold then what might be expected of comfortleſſe <hi>Beliſa,</hi> when ſhe ſhould vnderſtand of theſe gladſome ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The Nymph therfore caſting hir eies on <hi>Arſileus,</hi> not without teares of inward gladnes ſaid vnto him, I would I had thy ripe wit and fluent toong
<hi>(Arſileus)</hi> to make thee know what infinite pleaſure I conceiue by the good ſucceſſe, that Fortune hath ſolicited for my
<hi>Beliſa,</hi> becauſe I might otherwiſe be deceiued, by thinking that ſo ſimple a conceit and barren wordes as mine are, could declare it. I euer thought that the coutinuall griefe of my <hi>Beliſa</hi> ſhould be at length conuerted into great gladnes, induced thereunto by the great deſerts of her ſingular beautie, wiſdome, &amp; faith that ſhe hath euer kept firme and inuiolate, but did euer feare on the other ſide, that Fortune neuer made account to giue it her ſo amply, and in ſuch ſorte, as I did deſire it, bicauſe it is her condition (for the moſt parte) to bring her effectes to paſſe cleane contrarie to their deſires that loue well. Happie maieſt thou call thy ſelfe <hi>Arſileus,</hi> ſince thou didſt deſerue to bee ſo well beloued in life, that couldeſt not bee forgotten after death. And bicauſe the deferring of ſuch great ioy, for a hart that needes it ſo much, may not be too long, giue me leaue to goe and carrie ſo good newes to thy Shepherdeſſe, as thoſe of thy life, and of her deceiued minde. And depart not from this place vntill I come againe with her whom thou doſt ſo much deſire, and moſt deſerue to ſee. As I can expect nothing elſe (ſaide <hi>Arſileus</hi>) from ſuch excellent wiſdome, and exceeding beautie as thine, but all ioy and contentment whatſoeuer: euen ſo faire Nymph (bicauſe thou doſt ſo greatly deſire to giue it me) thy will be done, whereby I hope to gouerne my ſelfe as well in this, as in all things elſe, that ſhall enſue thereof. Whereupon they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king leaue of one another, <hi>Polydora</hi> went to tel <hi>Beliſa</hi> theſe inopinate newes, &amp; <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> remained ſtill, tarying for them vnder the pleaſant ſhadow of thoſe green Sica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, who (to entertaine the time with ſomething) as they are wont to doe, that are attending ſome ioyfull thing, tooke out his Rebecke, and to the tune of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan with ſweeteſt voice to ſing theſe verſes following.</p>

If thou kneweſt from whom this imbracement came, thou wouldſt with greater content (faire Shepherdeſſe) receiue it then now thou doſt. It can come from no part faire Nymph (ſaid ſhe) where I may more ioyfully accept it, then from thine owne ſelfe, ſince he, from whom with the ſupre moſt ioy in the world I ſhould entertaine it, is not now in the world: And I would deſire to liue no longer, if I were now altogither depriued of the content, that this miſerable life may at ſome times affoorde me, which onely I account, faire Nymph, thy friendly and gracious companie. This life (ſaide
<hi>Polydora</hi>) from henceforth I hope thou ſhalt enioy with more content then thou canſt imagine: And bicauſe thou maiſt knowe how, let vs ſit vnder the ſhade of this greene Sicamour, and I will acquaint thee with ſuch matters, as ſhall reuiue thy ſpirits, and decaied ſoule.
<hi>Beliſa,</hi> and the Nymphes ſat them downe taking <hi>Polydora</hi> in the mids, who ſaid to <hi>Beliſa.</hi> Tell me (faire Shepherdeſſe) how certaine art thou of the death of <hi>Arſenius</hi> and of <hi>Arſileus? Beliſa</hi> vnable to ſtop the ſudden eruption of her violent teares, anſwered. So certaine, as one that beheld that tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpectacle with her owne eies, the one ſhot thorow with an arrowe, the other killing himſelfe with his owne Faulchion. But what wilt thou ſay to one, that will tell thee, that theſe two, whom thou didſt ſee dead, are aliue, and in perfect health? Her would I anſwere (ſaide <hi>Beliſa</hi>) that told me this, that ſhe had a deſire to renew my teares, and to bring thoſe to my thoughts againe, whoſe remembrance is my death, or that ſhe tooke a delight to ſport her ſelfe with my greefes. I am certaine (ſaide
<hi>Polydora</hi>) thou thinkeſt not ſo of me, for thou knoweſt how thy cares haue touched me neerer then any other, to whom thou didſt euer impart them. But tell me what is that Shepherd of thy towne, that is called
<hi>Alfeus.</hi> The greateſt Coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (ſaid <hi>Beliſa</hi>) and the moſt cunning Magician that is (I thinke) in <hi>Europe,</hi> who did once fondly ſpend his time in louing and ſeruing me. He is a man (faire Nymph) whoſe dealing and conuerſation is altogether with Diuels, which he makes to take ſuch ſhapes vpon them as he liſt himſelfe, ſo that many times thou wouldſt thinke, thou wert talking with thy familiar acquaintance (into whoſe ſhape he transformeth ſome ſpirit or other) when indeede thou art talking with a very Diuell. Thou muſt therefore knowe faire Shepherdeſſe (ſaide <hi>Polydora</hi>) that the ſame <hi>Alfeus</hi> with his enchantments and diuelliſh deuiſes hath beene the cauſe of the deceite, wherein hitherto thou haſt liued, and of the infinite teares, that for the ſame thou haſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth, bicauſe knowing that <hi>Arſileus</hi> was to ſpeake with thee that night (as it was concluded betweene you) he cauſed two ſpirits to take the ſhapes of <hi>Arſileus</hi> and his father vpon them. And <hi>Arſileus</hi> deſiring to talke with thee, effected that, that ſhould fall out, which with thine eies thou didſt that night beholde. Bicauſe thinking they were dead, thou mighteſt deſpaire and kill thy ſelfe, or do that (at the leaſt) which thou haſt already done. When <hi>Beliſa</hi> heard what faire <hi>Polydora</hi> did tell her, ſhe was ſo farre beſide her-ſelfe, that for a while ſhe could not ſpeake one word, but comming to her-ſelfe again, ſhe ſaid vnto her. Thou haſt told me (faire Nymph) ſtrange things, if my ſorrow woulde giue me leaue to beleeue them. By that loue which (thou ſaieſt) thou doſt beare me, tell me (I beſeech thee) how thou knoweſt it, or of whom thou haſt vnderſtoode that thoſe two, which I ſawe dead before mine eies, were not <hi>Arſenius</hi> and <hi>Arſileus?</hi> Of no other ſaide
<hi>Polydora,</hi> but of <hi>Arſileus</hi> himſelfe. What, of

<hi>Arſileus</hi> doth liue, <pb n="139" facs="tcp:23115:74"/>and ſo nigh to bleſſe me with theſe happy newes? I will tell thee how poſſible it is (ſaide
<hi>Polydora</hi>) if thou wilt go with me, for before we come yonder to thoſe three hedges, which thou ſeeſt before thee, I will ſhew thee the man, that ſhal reſtore thy decayed hope, and reſtore thee thy life againe. O ſoueraigne Deities (ſaid <hi>Beliſa</hi>) what words do I heare? That the renuing of my ioyes &amp; felicitie is ſo apparant, and that my <hi>Arſileus</hi> is there? Why doſt thou not leade me (faire Nymph) to the place, where I may ſee him, and die at his feete with ioy of his happy ſight? Ah thou doſt not loue me <hi>(Polydora)</hi> ſo much as thou ſaieſt. This did the faire Shepherdeſſe ſpeake with an vncertaine kinde of ioy, and doubtfull hope of that, which ſhe ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. But
<hi>Polydora</hi> riſing vp, and taking her by the hand, and the Nymphes
<hi>Cynthia</hi> and <hi>Doria,</hi> who for ioy alſo to ſee
<hi>Beliſas</hi> good happe, would not ſtay behinde, went to the brooke, where <hi>Arſileus</hi> was: And before they came, a temperate aire, that came from the place where he ſat, rauiſhed their ſences with the ſweete voice of the enamoured Shepherd, who had not yet left off his muſicke, but ſtill began a freſh to ſing vpon this old prouerbe.

               <p>When <hi>Beliſa</hi> heard <hi>Arſileus</hi> his muſicke, ſhe felt ſuch inward ioy, as the like did neuer any, whereupon reſoluing with her ſelfe to ſhake off all former ſorrowe that had appalled that ſurpaſſing beautie, which nature had bountifully beſtowed on her, and decaied thoſe pleaſant lookes, and comely fauour (the onely ſource of
<hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> his teares and ſighes) in her ſweete and alluring face, now on a ſudden with a renewed grace and excellent beautie (whereat the Nymphes were not a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) ſhe ſpake in this ſort, ſaying. This is, without doubt, the voice of my <hi>Arſileus,</hi> if I doe not deceiue my ſelfe by calling him mine. When the Shepherd did ſee the cauſe of all his paſſed cares, and preſent contents before his eies, the ineffable ioy that he conceiued thereat was ſo great, that his hart vnable to comprehend it, was troubled in ſuch ſort, that at that inſtant he could not vtter a word: To whom the <pb n="140" facs="tcp:23115:75"/>Nymphes, perceiuing in what a traunce the ſight of his Shepherdeſſe had put <hi>Arſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi> moſt louingly came, when the Shepherd, ſuſpending that for a litle while, which the preſent ioy wrought in him, with many teares ſaide. With what wordes am I able to expreſſe the ſatisfaction that fortune hath made me for ſo many greefes and troubles, as for thy ſake (ſweete Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Beliſa</hi>) I haue endured. O who may giue me now a new hart, and not ſo diſtempered with ſorrowfull thoughts, to receiue into it ſuch vnſpeakable ioy as thy happy ſight preſents me! O fortune, I haue no more to requeſt of thee, and thou no more to giue me: yet onely one thing I aske thee, That, ſince it is thy faſhion to giue no ſupreme happineſſe without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heauineſſe, the great force of this vnexpected ioy, which thou haſt giuen me this ſeuenfold happy day, may with little ſorrowe (in liew of ſuch a ſoueraigne ſweete) and with ſuch an oppoſite, as may but a while countermaund this ſweete content, be mildly and with fauour tempered. And faire Nymphes, in whoſe ſacred guard and ampare, ſuch great treaſure hath bin diuinely preſerued, &amp; where it could neuer haue beene better imployed, let your harts reioice with mine, at this infinite ioy that reuiues it, which thing (if you your ſelues haue ſometimes loued well) ſhall ſeeme no leſſe then due to my reſtored good. O faire Shepherdeſſe, why doſt thou not ſpeake vnto me, doth it greeue thee to ſee me, or doſt thou take no delight in ſeeing thy <hi>Arſileus?</hi> hath his greeuous ſight troubled thy toong, or the extreme ioy thereof hindered the paſſage of thy golden wordes? Whom <hi>Beliſa</hi> anſwered thus. The ioy which I haue to ſee thee (my deere
<hi>Arſileus</hi>) were but little, if with words it might be told. Let it ſuffice thee to know in what continual panges and dangers of my life, thy ſuppoſed death hath put me, and by that thou ſhalt ſee what a world of ioy thy renewed life hath brought to this my mournfull ſoule. At the ende of which words, by reaſon of an iſſue of ſwelling teares aſcending vp from the center of her ſorrowfull hart into her eye brinkes, ſhe was not able to vtter out the reſt of her minde, which the tender harted Nymphes, being mollified with the milde and pitifull words of both theſe louers to one another, did helpe and accompany with theirs. And bicauſe night was comming on, they went all to <hi>Felicias</hi> houſe, telling to each other the diſcourſe &amp; accidents of their liues, which till then they had both paſſed. <hi>Beliſa</hi> asked her <hi>Arſileus</hi> for his father
<hi>Arſenius,</hi> who told her, that, as ſoone as he knew ſhe was gon, he went to one of his Farmes not far from thence, where he liues as quiet and contented a life, as he could wiſh, hauing put all mundane affaires in obliuion: whereat <hi>Beliſa</hi> was verie glad, and ſo they came to the Palace of ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> where they were welcommed with great ioye and feaſt, whoſe hands <hi>Beliſa</hi> kiſſed many times, ſaying, euermore that ſhee was the cauſe of her good Fortune. And ſo did

And as <hi>Feliſmena</hi> was telling the Shepherdeſſe the cauſe of her comming thither, a iolly Shepherd came to the Coate, though very ſad by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and gate. When <hi>Amarillis</hi> ſawe him, ſhe roſe vp in great haſte to be gone, but <hi>Feliſmena</hi> taking hold by her garment, and ſuſpecting what the cauſe of her ſudden departure might be, ſaid vnto her. It were not reaſon Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, that I ſhould receiue this diſcourteſie at thy hands, who deſires ſo much to ſerue thee. But as ſhe ſtriued to be gone from thence, the Shepherd with many teares ſaid vnto her. My deſire is <hi>(Amarillis)</hi> hauing reſpect to that, which thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt me ſuffer, not to ſee thee ſorie for this vnfortunate Shepherd, but to conſider what belongs to thy wiſedome and beautie, and that there is nothing in the worlde worſe beſeeming a Shepherdeſſe of thy braue qualities, then to intreate one ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly, that loues thee ſo entirely. Beholde theſe wearied eies <hi>(Amarillis)</hi> that haue ſhed ſo many teares, and then thou ſhalt ſee what reaſon thine haue to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo angrie againſt this miſerable man. Alas, that thou flieſt away from me, not ſeeing the reaſon thou haſt to abide my preſence. Stay <hi>Amarillis,</hi> and harken to my complaints, and to my iuſt excuſes, and if thou wilt not anſwere me at all, yet I will be content, ſo that thou ſtaieſt ſtill. What can it hinder thee to heare him, whom it hath ſo deerely coſt to ſee thee? And looking vpon
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> with many teares he beſought her, not to let her goe, who with ſweete and gentle wordes intreated the Shepherdeſſe not to vſe him with ſo ſmall pitie, whom he ſhewed to loue more then himſelfe, or that ſhe would (at the leſt) harken vnto him, ſince ſhe could not hurt hir ſelfe much by doing ſo litle. But <hi>Amarillis</hi> ſaid: Intreat me not (faire Shepherdeſſe) to giue eare to him, who beleeues his thoughts, more then my words. For behold, this Shepherd that ſtands in this fained ſort before thee, is one of the moſt diſloyall men, that euer liued, &amp; one of them that moſt of al troubles our ſimple louing Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes with his falſe deceits &amp; diſſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Then ſaid <hi>Filemon</hi> to <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> My onely requeſt and deſire is, faire Shepherdeſſe, that thou wouldſt be iudge in the cauſe betweene <hi>Amarillis</hi> and me, wherein if I am found culpable, or the iuſt prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of that anger, and ill opinion that ſhe hath wrongfully conceiued againſt me, that then I may looſe my life; and if ſhe be, that I may haue no other thing for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but her confeſſion, how much ſhe hath iniured, and owes me. To leeſe thy life (ſaid
<hi>Amarillis</hi>) I am ſure thou wilt not, bicauſe thou wilt not wiſh thy ſelfe ſo much harme, nor me ſo much good, as for my ſake to put thy life in aduenture. But I am content, that this faire Shepherdeſſe be iudge (if it pleaſe her) betweene vs, to conſider of our reaſons, and to declare which of vs both is more worthie of blame. Agreed (ſaid
<hi>Feliſmena</hi>) and let vs ſit downe at the foote of this greene hedge neere to the flouriſhing meadow before our eies, for I will ſee what reaſon you haue to complaine of one another. After they were all three ſet downe vpon the greene graſſe, <hi>Filemon</hi> began thus to ſay. I truſt faire Shepherdeſſe, if thou haſt at any time beene touched with the force of Loue, that thou ſhalt plainly perceiue what ſmall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23115:76"/>reaſon <hi>Amarillis</hi> hath to be angrie with me, &amp; to conceiue ſo ill an opinion of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained faith I beare her, which makes her ſurmiſe that, which neuer any other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe hath euer yet imagined of her louing Shepherd. Knowe therefore (faire Shepherdeſſe) that the fates (not onely when I was borne, but long before) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that I ſhould loue this faire Shepherdeſſe, which fits before thy faire &amp; my ſorrowfull eies, whoſe intents I haue anſwered with ſuch effect, as there is no loue (I thinke) like mine, nor any ingratitude like to hers. It fell out afterwardes, that from my childehood, ſeruing her in the beſt manner I coulde, there are fiue or ſixe moneths paſt, ſince my miſhap brought a Shepherd hither called
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> who went vp and downe ſeeking a Shepherdeſſe called
<hi>Beliſa,</hi> which by ſome ill ſucceſſe of Fortune, wandred like an exile heere and there amongſt theſe woodes &amp; groues. And as his ſorrow was very great, it fell out, that this cruell Shepherdeſſe, either for great pittie ſhe tooke of him, or for the little ſhe had of me, or for what cauſe elſe (ſhe knowes beſt herſelfe) woulde neuer be out of his companie: To whom if by chance I did but ſpeake thereof, ſhe was ready to kill me with anger; for thoſe eies which thou ſeeſt there, procure death no leſſe, when they are angry, then life when they are milde and gentle. But now when all my ſences were thus occupied, mine eies with teares, my eares with hearing denials, my thoughts with a bitter taſte of ſorrow, my ſoule with a rare and vnſpeakeable kind of affection, and my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the greateſt iealouſie, as the like neuer any had, I made my complaint to <hi>Arſileus</hi> with ſighes, and to the earth, and theſe groues with pitifull and bitter la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, ſhewing them what iniuries <hi>Amarillis</hi> did me. Her deceiued imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſuſpect, that I had of her honeſtie, hath bredde in her ſo great deſpite and hatred againſt me, that to be reuenged of me, ſhe hath hitherto perſeuered therein, which greeuous torment ſhe is not onely content to lay vpon me, but when ſhe ſees me before her eies, flies from my preſence, as the fearefull Hinde from the hungry and purſuing Hounde. So that by the loue which thou oweſt thy ſelfe, I pray thee (good Shepherdeſſe) iudge whether this be a ſufficient cauſe to make her thus abhorre me, and if my fault on the other ſide, be ſo great, that it deſerues ſuch endles and extreme hate. <hi>Filemon</hi> hauing made an end of the cauſe of his greefe and iniurie, wherewith his Shepherdeſſe tormented him; <hi>Amarillis</hi> began to ſhape her anſwer thus. This
<hi>Filemon</hi> (faire Shepherdeſſe) that ſits before thee, hath loued me well (I muſt needes confeſſe) or at the leaſt, made a fine ſhewe thereof, and ſuch haue his ſeruices beene towards me, that to ſay otherwiſe of him, then he deſerues, it would ill beſeeme me. But if for his ſake, in lieu and recompence of that affection, I haue not reiected the ſuites and ſeruice of many iolly Shepherds that feede their flockes vpon theſe downes, and in theſe pleaſant vales; and alſo (for his loue) haue not contemned many countrey youthes, whom nature hath enriched with no leſſe perfections then himſelfe, let himſelfe be iudge. For the infinite times, that with their amorous ſutes I haue beene importuned, and thoſe wherein I haue kept that firmnes due to his faith, haue not (I thinke) beene at any time out of his preſence, which neuertheleſſe ſhould be no ſufficient cauſe for him to make ſo ſmall account of me, as to imagine or ſuſpect any thing of that, wherein I am moſt of all bounde to my ſelfe. For if it be ſo, (as he knowes well enough) that for the loue of him I haue caſt off many, that died by mine occaſion, how coulde I then forget or reiect him for the loue of another? A thouſand times hath <hi>Filemon</hi> watched me, not leeſing a ſteppe that the Shepherd <hi>Arſileus</hi> and I haue troden amiddes theſe greene woods, and pleaſant vales, but let him ſay, if he euer heard <hi>Arſileus</hi> talke to <pb n="143" facs="tcp:23115:76"/>me of loue, or if I anſwered him any thing touching ſuch matter. What day did
<hi>Filemon</hi> euer ſee me talke to <hi>Arſileus,</hi> whereby he might conceiue any thing elſe by my words, but that I went about to comfort him in ſuch great forrow, as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: And if this be a ſufficient cauſe to make him thinke ill of his Shepherdeſſe, who can better iudge it, then himſelfe? Behold then (faire Shepherdeſſe) how much he was giuen to falſe ſuſpects and wrongfull iealouſie, that my wordes could neuer ſatisfie him, nor worke with him, to make him leaue off his obdurate minde by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting himſelfe from this valley, thinking therby to haue made an end of my daies, wherein he was deceiued, when as he rather ended his owne ioy and contentment, if for me at the leaſt he had euer any at all. And this was the michiefe beſides, that <hi>Filemon</hi> being not onely content to beare mee ſuch a kinde of vniuſt iealouſie, whereof he had ſo ſmall occaſion, as now (faire Shepherdeſſe) thou haſt ſeene, hee did likewiſe publiſh it at euerie feaſt, in all bridales, wreſtlings, and mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that were made amongſt the Shepherds of theſe hilles. And this thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt (good Shepherdeſſe) howe it did preiudice mine honour more then his contentment: In the ende hee abſented himſelfe from mee, which courſe ſince hee hath taken for a medicine of his malladie (which it ſeemes hath the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed it) let him not finde fault with me, if I haue knowne how to profit my ſelfe more thereby then he hath. And now that thou haſt ſeene (faire Shepherdeſſe) what great content that I felt, when thou toldſt the Shepherd <hi>Arſileus</hi> ſo good newes of his Shepherdeſſe, &amp; that I my ſelfe was moſt earneſt with him to haue him go and ſeeke her out, it is cleere, that there could not be any thing between vs, that might inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſuch cauſe of ſuſpition, as this Shepherd hath wrongfully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued of vs. So that this is the cauſe, that hath made me not only ſo cold in the loue that I did beare him, but not to loue any more, wherby to put mine honor &amp; good name in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of falſe ſuſpects, ſince my good hap hath brought me to ſuch a time, that (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forcing my ſelfe) I may do it at mine own choiſe &amp; libertie. After <hi>Amarillis</hi> had ſhewed the ſmall reaſon the Shepherd had to giue ſo great credit to his iealous ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and the libertie wherein time, and her good fortune had put her (a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thing to free harts) the woefull Shepherd replied in this ſort. I doe not denie <hi>(Amarillis)</hi> but that thy wiſedome and diſcretion is ſufficient to cleere thee of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition. But wilt thou now make nouelties in loue, &amp; inuent other new effects, then thoſe which we haue heretofore ſeene? When a louer would loue well, the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of iealouſie torments his foule, how much more when thoſe were greater, which by thy priuie conuerſation and familiaritie with <hi>Arſileus</hi> thou haſt giuen me. Doſt thou thinke
<hi>(Amarillis)</hi> that for a iealouſie certainties are needfull? Alas thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, for ſuſpicions be the principall cauſes of their entrance: which was alſo no great matter, ſince I beleeued that thou didſt beare <hi>Arſileus</hi> good will, the publiſhing whereof was as little preiudiciall and leſſe offenſiue to thine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſince the force of my loue was ſo great, that it made mee manifeſt the ill that I did feare. And though thy goodnes aſſured mee, when, at ſtealth and deceite of my ſuſpectes, I thought thereof, yet I alwaies feared, leaſt ſome aduerſe ſucceſſe might befall vnto me, if this familiaritie had beene ſtill continued. But to that thou ſaieſt (faire Shepherdeſſe) that I abſented my ſelfe, I anſwere, that vpon a ſtomacke, or to giue thee any offence or greefe thereby, I did it not; but to ſee if I could haue any remedie in mine owne, not ſeeing the cauſe of my great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap and greefe before mine eies, and bicauſe my purſutes might not alſo offende thee. But if by ſeeking remedy for ſo great an ill, I went againſt that, which I owed <pb n="144" facs="tcp:23115:77"/>thee, what greater puniſhment can I haue, then that which thy abſence hath made me feele? If thou ſaieſt thou didſt neuer loue <hi>Arſileus,</hi> it giues me greater occaſion to complaine of thee, ſince for a thing of ſo ſmall importance, thou didſt forſake him, who ſo greatly deſired to ſerue thee. So that I haue the more cauſe to accuſe thee, the leſſe thy loue was to <hi>Arſileus.</hi> And theſe are the reaſons <hi>Amarillis</hi> and manie more, which I do alleage, not in mine owne excuſe and fauour, whereby I thinke not to helpe my ſelfe at all, ſince in matters of loue they are woont to profite ſo little; onely requeſting thee (gentle <hi>Amarillis</hi>) that thy clemencie and the faith which I haue euer borne thee, may be of my ſide, and mooue thee vnto pittie, the want whereof can preſcribe no ende to my greefe, nor meanes of reconciliation in thy hard condition and crueltie. And with this the Shepherd made an ende of his words, and began to poure forth ſo many teares, that they were ſufficient (with the requeſts and ſentence that
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> gaue in his behalfe) to mollifie <hi>Amarillis</hi> hard hart, and to make the enamoured Shepherd come againe into her good grace and liking, for which he was ſo glad a man, as neuer more; and <hi>Amarillis</hi> not a little ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by ſhewing how much <hi>Filemon</hi> was deceiued in his falſe ſuſpicions of her. And after this, they paſſed away that day with great content of the two reconciled lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and with greater ſorrow of faire <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> who next day early in the morning departed from them after many embracings, and promiſes, to ſende to each other newes of their affaires.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Syrenus</hi> being now free from loue, and
<hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> more enamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then euer before, and faire <hi>Diana,</hi> not a little diſcontent for the ſorrowfull ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of her affaires, paſſed away her melancholike life, feeding her flocke along the bankes of the great riuer <hi>Ezla,</hi> where, many times meeting with one another, they talked of that, which pleaſed their fancies beſt. And diſcreete <hi>Seluagia</hi> being on a day at the fountaine of the Sicamours, the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> came thither by chance, to ſeeke a lambe that had runne out of the foulde, which <hi>Syluanus</hi> had tyed to a myrtle tree, for when they came thither, they founde it drinking at the cleere ſpring and by the marke knewe it to be faire <hi>Dianas.</hi> But being come (as I ſay) and curteouſly welcommed of the newe louers, they ſat them downe vpon the greene graſſe, leaning to one of the Sicamours, that ſtoode about the fountaine, and after they had talked of many matters,
<hi>Syluanus</hi> ſaide vnto her. Why doſt thou not aske vs (faire
<hi>Diana</hi>) for <hi>Syrenus?</hi> Bicauſe I woulde not talke of matters paſt (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) for the great greefe which preſent things do giue me: The time was, when I tooke more delight to aske for him, and hee for mee, and to ſpeake and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with one another then now, which giues neither of vs the like contentment; but time doth cure infinite cares, that ſeeme remedileſſe to many men, which if I vnderſtood not ſo, there could not be now a <hi>Diana</hi> in theſe faire meades &amp; plaines, in regard of the ſorrowes and care that are daily offred me. God neuer graunt ſo much harme to our pleaſant fieldes (ſaide <hi>Seluagia</hi>) by depriuing them of ſuch great beautie as hers is. That ſhall not be wanting as long as thou liueſt (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) and whereſoeuer thy grace and perfections are, little may be loſt by my want, in truth whereof, behold thy <hi>Syluanus,</hi> who (I thought) would neuer haue forgotten me for any other Shepherdeſſe, and yet in the end hath ſhaken hands with me for thy loue, which deſerued a great deale more. This did <hi>Diana</hi> ſpeake with a gracious ſmile, although ſhe laughed not ſo much in minde at theſe things, nor with ſo good a hart as they thought. For though ſhe once loued <hi>Syrenus</hi> more then her owne life, and deſpiſed
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> as nothing ſo much, yet it greeued her more, that
<hi>Syluanus</hi> 
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:23115:77"/>had forgotten her for the loue of another, whoſe ſight he now enioyed euery day with great contentment of his newe loue, then that <hi>Syrenus</hi> had freed himſelfe out of her loue, whom nowe no new affection mooued. When <hi>Syluanus</hi> heard what
<hi>Diana</hi> ſaid, he anſwered her thus. Time, and the reuolutions of the heauens ſhall firſt ceaſe (faire <hi>Diana</hi>) before I will forget thee, for thy beautie and wiſedome is not ſuch, that may be euer put in obliuion. Truth it is that I am now bound to my <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia,</hi> bicauſe (beſides many other good parts in her obliging me to her loue) ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer eſteemed her Fortune to bee woorſe by this, that ſhe is nowe beloued of him, whom thou did'ſt alway ſo reiect and make ſo ſmall account of. No more of this (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) for thou art well beſtowed, and I was not well aduiſed by not louing thee, as thy loue deſerued it at my hands. But if at anytime thou didſt deſire to giue me ſome content, I beſeech thee (al I may) and thy faire <hi>Seluagia,</hi> to ſing ſome ſong, to entertaine the time, and to paſſe the heate of the day a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About this time came <hi>Syrenus</hi> downe from the village towards the fountaine of the Sicamours, with great deſire to meete
<hi>Seluagia</hi> or <hi>Syluanus,</hi> for hee nowe tooke no greater delight in any thing, then in the company of theſe two louers. And if he had (perhaps) a touch of <hi>Dianas</hi> loue in his memorie, the time that he had ſpent in louing her, did not leaue him altogither without ſome penſiue thoughts, not, for that her loue now gaue him any paine; but becauſe the remembrance of a good eſtate, doth breed ſome ſmall kind of griefe and diſcontent in him that hath loſt it. Before he came to the fountaine, in the mids of the greene meadow which was beſet round about with Myrtles and Laurels, he found <hi>Dianas</hi> ſheepe, that went by themſelues all alone feeding amongſt the trees vnder the keeping of two fierce maſties. And as the Shepherd ſtaied to looke vpon them, thinking of the time, wherein he had greater care of them, then of his owne, the maſties with great furie came running vpon him. But when they came ſomewhat nigh and knew him, by wagging their tailes, and holding downe their necks (that were armed with collers of ſharpe nailes) the one fell downe at his feete; and the other by skipping vpon him fawned on him with the greateſt ioy in the world. And the ſheepe did no leſſe, for the Bell-wether with his rurall bleating came to the Shepherd, whom all the reſt followed, and knowing <hi>Syrenus,</hi> came round about him, which ſight he could not behold without teares, calling to mind that ſometimes in the company of faire <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> he had fed that gentle flocke. And ſeeing that in the ſilly beaſts that loue and knowledge did abound, which wanted in their miſtreſſe, it was ſo forcible a motion in his minde, that if the vertue of the water, which ſage
<hi>Felicia</hi> had giuen him, had not made him forget his olde loue: it might well haue beene, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the worlde that coulde haue let him from renewing it againe. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe thus in the mids of
<hi>Dianas</hi> ſheepe, and with the thoughts, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of ſuch a thing did put before his eies, to the tune of his merie Recbecke he began to ſing this ſong.</p>

               <p>After <hi>Syrenus</hi> had made an ende of his ſong, faire
<hi>Diana</hi> knewe him by his voice, and ſo did the two enamoured Shepherdes <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia.</hi> They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him, telling him, that if he was minded to paſſe away the heate of the day in the field, there was the freſh fountaine of the Sicamours, and faire
<hi>Diana,</hi> both which ſhould be no ſmall allurements to inuite him thither. <hi>Syrenus</hi> anſwered him, that be muſt needs ſtay all day in the field, vntill it was time to go home againe with his ſheepe to the towne, and comming where the Shepherd and Shepherdeſſes were, they ſat round about the cleere fountaine, as they were commonly woont to do. But
<hi>Diana,</hi> (whoſe life was ſo ſorrowfull, as one may imagine, that euer ſawe a Shepherdeſſe, the faireſt and wiſeſt that was then knowne, married ſo greatly to her greefe) went day by day ſeeking out new occaſions to entortaine the time, and to paſſe her life away, and ſtudying often to preuent her continuall and ſorrowfull thoughts. But the Shepherdes ſitting and talking of other matters touching the feeding of ſheepe, and their profite, <hi>Diana</hi> brake off the ſubſtance of their talke, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Syluanus.</hi> It is a proper thing, Shepherd, that, ſitting before thy faire <hi>Seluagia,</hi> thou talkeſt of other impertinent things, and not of praiſing her beautie, nor of the great loue, that ſhe beares thee: Let the field and lambes alone, the good or ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time and fortune, and enioy the good hap that (Shepherd) thou haſt nowe, by being beloued of ſo faire a Shepherdeſſe, for where there is ſo great reaſon to haue continually ſuch contentment of minde, thou need'ſt not care for that, which Fortune doth but ſometimes giue. How much I am beholding to thee <hi>Diana</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Syluanus</hi>) none can expreſſe but he, that knowes what great reaſon I haue to acknowledge this debt, bicauſe thou didſt not onely then teach me to loue well, but now alſo ſheweſt me the way to vſe the contentment, that my loue affoordes me: The reaſon thou haſt to warne me, not to talke of any other matter (my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe being in preſence) but onely of the content that by her ſight I receiue, is great &amp; infinite, the which I promiſe thee (faire
<hi>Diana</hi>) to do, while my happy ſoule ſhall be conteined in this ioyfull body. But I maruell at one thing, to ſee how thy <hi>Syrenus</hi> doth caſt his eies another way, when thou ſpeakeſt vnto him, it ſeemes thy wordes pleaſe him not, or that he is not ſatisfied with thy anſwers. Blame him not (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) for careleſſe men &amp; enimies to their own good will do more then this. Enimy to mine own good (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus?</hi>) If I was euer ſuch an one, let death puniſh me for my error. This is a prety ſhift to excuſe thy fault. To excuſe my fault (ſaid <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana?</hi>) If I haue not yet the firſt offence to do thee, I pray God I may neuer haue any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent, then that, which I now enioy: It is wel that thou doſt finde fault with me for being married hauing parets. But it is wel (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) that thou didſt marry hauing another Loue: And what power had that Loue (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) where obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:23115:79"/>was due to parents? And what power had thoſe parents (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) that obedience, thoſe times, thoſe fauourable or ſiniſtrous ſucceſſes of Fortune, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule ſo true a Loue, as before my departure thou didſt ſhew me? Ah <hi>Diana,</hi> I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought there was any thing in the worlde, that could diſſolue ſo great a faith as that, and how much more <hi>Dianas,</hi> conſidering that well thou mighteſt haue mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and not forgotten him, who loued thee ſo entyrely. But thinking of the matter vnappaſſionately, it was now better for me, ſince thou wert reſolued to marrie, and being married, to forget me quite. For what reaſon ſaide <hi>Diana?</hi> For what, ſaide <hi>Syrenus?</hi> Bicauſe there is no woorſe thing in the worlde, then for a Shepherd to loue a Shepherdeſſe that is married, nor that makes him, (that beares her true loue and affection) ſooner to looſe his wits and ſences: the reaſon whereof (as wee all know) is, that the principall paſſion which doth torment a louer (after the deſire of his Miſtres) is cruell iealouſie: For what doſt thou then thinke, that a poore vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Louer that loues wel is able to do, what griefe (thinkeſt thou) he paſſeth, when he knowes, that his Shepherdeſſe is in the armes of her new married husband, and he bewailing and weeping his diſgrace and ill Fortune in the ſtreete. And this is not all the torment, when ſuch a miſcheefe and death remaines yet thereof, that he muſt not complaine of it at all, but muſt ſuffer (ſilly man) and holde his peace, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by complaining he ſhall be thought no leſſe then a foole or a madde man (a thing as contrarie to his reſt as may be:) For if the iealouſies were of ſome other Shepherd, that ſerued her, by complayning of the fauours ſhe doth him, and by hearing her excuſes, the Louer might better paſſe away his greefe; but this is ſuch a kinde of torment, that in an inſtant one ſhall looſe it, if he haue no ſtay in his deſire. Leaue of this talke (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) for thou haſt no neede to loue, nor to be beloued. In reſpect of not hauing it to loue (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) I am glad in not hauing it alſo to be beloued. Strange is thy libertie (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) but ſtranger was thy forgetfulnes (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) if thou doſt remember well the words thou ſpakeſt to mee at my departure. But let vs (as thou ſaieſt) leaue of to ſpeake of things which are paſt, &amp; let vs thanke time and Lady
<hi>Felicia</hi> for thoſe that are preſent. And thou <hi>Syluanus,</hi> take thy Pipe, and I will tune my Rebecke to it, and let vs ſing ſome verſes togither, although ſo free a hart as mine cannot ſing of anie thing, that may giue content to thine, that is of another qualitie. I will giue thee a good remedie for this (ſaide <hi>Syluanus:</hi>) For let vs imagine that we are both in the ſame caſe, as this Shepherdeſſe made vs liue, when we filled theſe hils and dales with our amorous complaints.
<hi>Syluanus</hi> deuiſe liked them all well, but <hi>Seluagia</hi> was a little diſpleaſed thereat, who for that time, (bicauſe ſhe would not ſeeme to be iealous, where ſhe was aſcertained of ſo great loue) helde her peace: And the Shepherds began to ſing in manner following.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23115:81"/>ſhe did not let it paſſe out of her minde, but thought, that after ſo many trauels, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would be wearie at the laſt of troubling her any more: And theſe imaginations ſupported her ſomewhat in the greateſt torments of her deſire. But trauelling one morning on her way, thorow the mids of a woode, and at the going out of certaine thick buſhes which appeared fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of a high hill, ſhe beheld before her a moſt pleaſant and greene Champaine that lay all along beneath the hill, and of ſuch length, that ſhe could ſcarce ſee to the end of it; for twelue miles right out it butted vpon the bottoms of certaine hils, that might hardly be diſcerned. Thorow the mids of this pleaſant plaine a goodly riuer ranne, which in many places made freſh and faire bankes on both ſides, whereon grew thicke Birches, greene Sicamours, and diuers other trees; and in other places leauing the criſtalline waters diſcouered to the wandring view, and in ſome (brinked with ſandie plats) did from a far off more brauely beautifie the faire riuer bankes. The graine which was ſowne in all thoſe fields, was at hand to yeeld vp the deſired fruit, and by reaſon of the fertill ſoyle was verie well growen: which being mooued by a little gale of winde, waued vp and downe ſome in greene, &amp; ſome in yellow colours, which made moſt pleaſant ſhades and delightful obiects to the greedie eie. The greene and delectable vale was in ſome places three miles broad, and in others a little more, and in none leſſe then this. The faire Shepherdeſſe therefore comming downe her way from the hil aboue, entered into a great wood full of Sicamours and wilde Oliue trees; in the middes whereof were many ſtately houſes ſo ſumptuouſly built, that they made her not a little to maruell: And lifting vp her eies on a ſudden, there appeared to her ſight a great and faire Citie, which being full of faire houſes and ſtately buildings, from the top of a rockie hill that was right before her, reached in breadth with the wals to the great riuer that ranne thorow the mids of the plaine. The buildings of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous citie were high, and wrought with as great arte, as humaine induſtrie could deuiſe. Amongſt the which were many towres, Pyramydes, and ſhining pinnacles, reared vp to the skies. The Temples were many, and ſumptuous, the houſes ſtrong, the wals loftie and ſtrongly embattelled; the bulwarkes thicke and full of munition: ſo that excelling in ſtately ſtructure and euen proportion, it made a faire ſhow, and gaue a goodly glorie to the great and auncient Citie: all which from that place ſhe ſeuerally beheld. The Shepherdeſſe was amazed to ſee that braue ſight, and on the ſudden to be ſo neere ſo faire a Citie; from whence, as from all other popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe with great care ſhe endeuored to flie. And yet ſhe could not chooſe, but ſat her downe a little vnder the ſhadow of an Oliue tree, to behold from thence all in particular which you haue heard; and ſeeing that populous Citie, great <hi>Soldina</hi> her natiue Citie and Countrey came to her muſing thoughts; from whence, the loue that ſhe bare <hi>Don Felix</hi> had exiled her, which was an occaſion not to make her paſſe it out of her memorie without teares, bicauſe the remembrance of a good thing loſt, doth for the moſt part offer occaſions of no leſſe. But the faire Shepherdeſſe leauing that place and citie on the right hand, went ſoftly on by a path hard by the riuer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that part, where the Criſtalline waters with a gentle and pleaſant noiſe runne ſmoothly into the Ocean. And hauing gone ſixe miles by the pleaſant bankes of that riuer, ſhe eſpied two Shepherdeſſes at the foote of a great Oke neere to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſide, paſſing away the heat of the day, both which (though they were but meane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faire) yet in ſweete fauour and gentle behauiour, were paſſing gracious. The hew of their faces was a nutbrowne ſanguine, but amiable, the colour of their haire, a darke browne-abram; their eies and eiebrowes blacke, and yet of a ſweete and mild <pb n="153" facs="tcp:23115:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>aſpect in their countenances. Vpon their hands they had ſeuerall garlandes of greene Iuie, tied vp togither with many roſes and ſweete flowers. The faſhion of their attire ſeemed to her to be different from any other kind of apparell, that ſhe had ſeene till that time. But one of them riſing vp in great haſte, to driue a flocke of ſheepe out of a flaxe field, where they had broken in, and the other going to driue her goates to the riuer to drinke, they went and ſat them downe againe vnder the ſhadow of that leafie Oke.
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> that had hid her ſelfe in a plat of high bulru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, and ſo neere to the Shepherdeſſes, that ſhe might well heare what paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, vnderſtood that the language they ſpake, was the Portugal toong, and that the kingdome wherein ſhe was, was Portugall; for one of the Shepherdeſſes taking the other by the hand with a ſweete grace in her owne toong ſaid thus to the other. Ah my <hi>Duarda,</hi> what ſmall reaſon haſt thou to deſpiſe him, who loues thee more then himſelfe? How better beſeeming thee were it, not ſo ill to entreate a thought that is ſo much employed in thy perfections? It greeues mee that ſo faire a Shepherdeſſe ſhoulde bee ſo farre from pitying him that hath ſo great neede thereof. The other, that ſeemed to bee more at libertie, with a certaine diſdaine, and a fillippe of her hande (a common note of careleſſe and free mindes) anſwered her thus. Wilt thou haue me tell thee, <hi>Armia?</hi> If I ſhould truſt him another time, who hath ſo ill apaied the loue I bare him, he ſhall not beare the blame of the ill, that I ſhall procure by mine owne deſire, but my ſelfe. Lay not before mine eies the ſeruices, that this Shepheard hath ſometimes done me, nor tell me the reaſons that he giues thee to mooue me, for the time is now paſt, when they once helpt him. He promiſed to marrie me, and behold he hath married another. What would he nowe haue? Or what pretendes this enemie of my quiet reſt? What, now that his wife is dead, would he haue me marrie him? O God forbid that I ſhould doe my ſelfe ſo great iniurie. Let him go, <hi>Armia,</hi> let him go: for if he loues me ſo much as he ſaith, this loue ſhall ſerue me for a renenge of his deepe deceite. The other ioyning her ſmiling face to
<hi>Duardas</hi> ſrowning countenance, and louingly imbracing her, with milde &amp; gentle wordes replied thus. How wel hath all becomen thee, gracious Shepherdeſſe, which thou haſt ſaid? I would neuer deſire to be a man, but euen now, to loue thee more then mine owne ſelfe. But tell me,
<hi>Duarda,</hi> why art thou ſo deſirous to haue <hi>Danteus</hi> leade ſo ſorrowfull a life? He ſaith, the reaſon that thou haſt to complaine of him, ſerues him for his excuſe. For, before he married, being with thee one day neere to the hedge of <hi>Fremoſelle,</hi> he ſaide vnto thee. <hi>Duarda,</hi> my father wil marrie me, what is thy aduiſe in this matter? And that thou didſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him roughly. How now <hi>Danteus?</hi> Am I ſo olde, or haue I ſo great power ouer thee, that thou doſt aske my opinion and leaue for thy marriage? Thou maieſt doe what thou liſt, and what thine owne will and thy fathers ſhall oblige thee to: for in the like caſe I my ſelfe would do no leſſe: And this was ſpoken with an eſtranged countenance, and not with that woonted kinde of milde and gentle ſpeech, but as if it had beene quite paſt thy memorie, that thou didſt once loue him well. Calleſt thou this an excuſe (ſaid <hi>Duarda</hi>) If I knew thee not <hi>Armia,</hi> ſo well as I doe, thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion ſhould hazard their credit with me. What ſhould I anſwere a Shepherd, who publiſhed euery where, that there was nothing in the world wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he would caſt an affectionate eie, but on me, how much more then, that <hi>Danteus</hi> was not ſo ignorant, but that he vnderſtood by my countenance and manner of my wordes, that with my will I would not haue anſwered him, as I did. What a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie was this (I pray thee
<hi>Armia</hi>) for him to meete me one day before this came to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:23115:82"/>paſſe, neere to the fountaine, and with many teares to ſay thus vnto me. Why are thou ſo vngratefull <hi>(Duarda)</hi> to the good will which I beare thee, that thou wilt not be married to me without thy fathers conſent? when time (thou knoweſt) will weare out the anger, that they may conceiue thereof. Whom I then anſwered thus. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelfe
<hi>Danteus,</hi> that I am thine, and that I can neuer be any others, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall befall vnto me. And thy word and promiſe, which thou haſt giuen me to be my husband, contents me well ynough: deſire not then, in reſpect of ſtaying a little time longer, a thing, whereof ſuch miſchiefe may enſue. At which wordes he tooke his leaue, telling me the next day that his father would marrie him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting me to giue him leaue, and not content with this, but to be married in deede three daies after. Doſt thou not therefore thinke this <hi>(Armia)</hi> a ſufficient reaſon for me, to vſe the benefite of that libertie, which with ſuch trouble of my thoughts I haue at laſt obtained? Theſe are things (ſaide the other) ſoone ſpoken and paſſed betweene the trueſt louers, but muſt not be taken ſo much at the hart, nor ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly interpreted, as thou doſt vnderſtand them. For thoſe, which are ſpoken, thou haſt reaſon,
<hi>Armia;</hi> but for thoſe that are done, thou ſeeſt it well ynough, if they touch not our ſoules too neere, that loue well. In the ende
<hi>Danteus</hi> married, and it greeues me not a little, that ſo faire a Shepherdeſſe liued ſo ſmall a time, and more, to ſee that one whole moneth after her buriall being ſcarce paſt, new thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to occupie his minde againe. God tooke her away (ſaid <hi>Armia</hi>) to the end that
<hi>Danteus</hi> might be thine, for indeede he could be no others but thine. If this be ſo (ſaid <hi>Duarda</hi>) that he that is ones, cannot be anothers, I finde my ſelfe now to be mine owne; and therefore cannot be
<hi>Danteus</hi> his. But let vs leaue of a thing not worth the loſſe of time that is ſpent about it, which ſhal be better imployed in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſong: And then both of them in their owne toong with a ſweete grace began to ſing that which followeth.</p>

<hi>Feliſmena</hi> came out of the place, where ſhe had hid her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, directly to that place where the Shepherdeſſes were, who amazed at her ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſight, but more at her rare grace and beautie, went to her, and with louing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings welcommed her, asking her of what countrey ſhe was, and from whence ſhe came. To which demaundes faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> could not anſwer, but with manie teares asked them what countrey that was, wherein they nowe where. For by her owne toong ſhe cleerely made them knowe, that ſhe was of <hi>Vandalia,</hi> and that for a certaine miſhap ſhe was baniſhed from her countrey. The Portugall Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes with their pitifull teares did the beſt they could to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort her, being very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for her exile, a common thing to that nation, &amp; more proper to the inhabitants of that prouince. And <hi>Feliſmena</hi> asking them what citie that was, which ſhe had left, where the riuer with his chriſtalline ſtreames, and ſpeedy courſe came running on with great force: and bicauſe ſhe alſo deſired to know, what caſtle that
<hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayor</hi> was, which was ſcituate on the hill, higher then the reſt, and many other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, one of them called <hi>Duarda,</hi> tolde her, that the citie was <hi>Coymbra,</hi> one of the moſt famons &amp; principall cities, not onely of that kingdome, but of all Europe, for the braue territories &amp; fieldes about it, which that great riuer (called
<hi>Mondego</hi>) wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with his cleereſt waters. And that all thoſe fieldes, where with great ſwiftnes it ranne, were called the fieldes of
<hi>Mondego:</hi> And that the caſtle which ſhe ſawe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, was the ancient light and glory of Spaine; which name (ſhe ſaide) did bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fit it, then the right name of it, bicauſe in the mids of the infidelitie of
<hi>Marſilius</hi> the Mahometicall king, who had ſo many yeeres encompaſſed it with a cruell and continuall ſiege, it did euer ſo ſtrongly defend it ſelfe, that it was alwaies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and neuer ſubdued, and that it was called in the Portugall toong <hi>Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> or
<hi>Velho,</hi> where the vertue, valour, wiſedome, and magnanimitie remained for trophees of the noble deedes, that the Lords and Knights of it did in thoſe daies, and that the Lords and Ladies that now dwelt in it, flouriſhed in all kinde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and commendable parts. And ſo did the Shepherdeſſe tell her manie other things of the fertilitie of the foile, of the antiquitie of the buildings, of the riches of the inhabitants, of the beautie, diſcretion, and vertues of the Nymphes &amp; Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſes, and of the aptnes and actiuitie of the iolly Shepherdes, that dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that impregnable caſtle: All which things did put <hi>Feliſmena</hi> in great admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

And whiles ſhe was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that which the Shepherdeſſes had ſet before her, they ſawe her ſhed ſo manie teares, that cauſed no ſmall ſorrow in them both. And deſirous to aske her the cauſe of them, they were hindred by the voice of a Shepherd, that came ſweetely ſinging to the tune of his Rebecke, whom the Shepherdeſſes knewe to be the Shepherd <hi>Danteus,</hi> for whom <hi>Armia</hi> pleaded ſo much to the gracious <hi>Duarda</hi> for pitie and pardon. Who ſaide to
<hi>Feliſmena.</hi> Although theſe are but homely cates (faire Shepherdeſſe) and countrey Shepherdeſſes fare, yet fals it out to be a dinner for a Princeſſe, for thou didſt but little thinke when thou cam'ſt hither, to dine with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.

               <p>The Shepherds muſicke pleaſed <hi>Feliſmena</hi> better then the Shepherdeſſes meat, for ſhe thought the ſong was made to complaine more of his owne griefe, then to lament an others. And as he made an ende, ſhe ſaid. Shepherd, it ſeemes thou haſt truely learned by my ils to complaine of thine owne. Vnfortunate woman, that can neither heare, nor ſee any thing, which ſets not before me the ſmall reaſon I haue, to deſire life. But yet God grant I may ſo long enioy it, vntil mine eies may ſee the cauſe of their burning teares. Thinkeſt thou faire Shepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Armia</hi> to her) that theſe words deſerue not to be heard, and that the hart, from whence they came forth, to be more eſteemed then this Shepherdeſſe regards them? Talke not ſaide
<hi>Duarda</hi> of his words, talke of his works; ſpeake not of his dittie, but of his deeds, for by them his intent and meaning is to be iudged. If thou doſt enamour thy ſelfe of ſongs, and delighteſt in Sonets compacted of induſtrie of fine and flattering words; Thinke not, that I do ſo: for as they are things wherein I take leaſt pleaſure; ſo by them I leſſe perſwade me of the loue he beares me. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> then fauouring
<hi>Duardas</hi> reaſon, ſaid. Behold <hi>Armia,</hi> how many ils might be auoided, and great miſchiefes not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, if we would not hearken to ſmooth &amp; filed ſpeeches, &amp; lightly credit words framed by free harts: for, by nothing elſe they ſhew their properties more, then by a cunning and falſe tale, vttered by an eloquent &amp; fine toong; that when we thinke it moſt true, there is nothing more falſe. Vnhappie me, that could not in time helpe my ſelfe with this counſell. But by this time was the Porugall Shepherd come where the Shepherdeſſes were, who in his owne language ſaide to <hi>Duarda.</hi> If the teares of theſe eies, and the ſighes of this my hart are not ſufficient (Shepherdeſſe) to mollifie that hardnes, wherewith thou doſt ſo ill intreate me, I require nothing elſe, but that my company may not be troubleſome vnto thee in theſe fields, and that the ſorrowfull verſes (which my griefe makes me ſing, like to the dying ſwanne neere to this riuer) may be no occaſion of thy miſcontent and trouble. Paſſe away (faire <pb n="157" facs="tcp:23115:83"/>Shepherdeſſe) the parching heate of the day vnder the ſhade of theſe greene Oſiars, for thy ſwaine will driue thy goates to the riuer to drinke, and tarrie with them, while they are waſhing themſelues in the criſtalline waters. Kembe and adreſſe (louely Shepherdeſſe) thy ſilke ſoft haire vpon the brinke of this cleere fountaine, from whence iſſueth out the running brook, that round about watereth this ſweete meadow: And in the meane time I will carrie thy faire flocks to feed, and keepe thy ſheep from going into the corne, that growes along the riuer ſide. I pray thee (ſweet Shepherdeſſe) take no care for anything, for I haue no reſt all the while that I am not trauelling about thy buſines. If this ſeemes to thee but a ſmall token of loue, tell me then, wherein I may ſhew the good will &amp; entire affection that I beare thee? For no eſpeciall loue doth wrong (to ſpeake the truth) in anything whereof it offers any experience at all. <hi>Danteus</hi> hauing made an end, the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Duarda</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him thus. If it be true
<hi>(Danteus)</hi> that there is any loue in the world, I haue borne it thee, and as great, as thou thy ſelfe knoweſt. Neuer any of theſe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, that bring their flockes to ſeede in the fieldes of <hi>Mondego,</hi> and to drinke in theſe cleere waters, obtained ſo much as one onely word of me, whereby thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt haue occaſion to complaine of <hi>Duarda,</hi> nor of the loue that ſhe hath euer ſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen thee. Thy teares, and burning ſighes haue neuer touched any neerer at the hart then me. The day, mine eies beheld thee not, could not ſee anything that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. The bullocks that thou didſt keepe, were of more account to me, and I had a greater care of them, then of mine owne. And (for the moſt part) fearing, leaſt the keepers of this delightfull Champaine might hinder their feed, I went to the top of this little hill, to ſee if I could eſpie them, whereas I brought mine in place, when they could not feed the graſſe of theſe faire riuer bankes, without feare of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. And I was not afraid to put my ſelfe in this ſubiection and danger, to put thee in aſſurance and ſafetie. I know well, that of this my ſubiect and apparant kind of loue thy affiance did ariſe; and of thy affiance, that which thou doſt. Thou did'ſt marie <hi>Andreſa</hi> (whoſe ſoule is now in glorie) a thing that in times paſt, made me to die for griefe: but I prayed to God, that I might ſee my ſelfe at laſt reuenged of her and thee, and after thy marriage I haue ſuffered that, which thou and others ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently knowe: And in the end my Fortune hath concluded, that thine ſhall giue me no more paine and care. Let me then inioy my libertie, and hope not to regaine that with me, which by thine owne folly and default thou haſt ſo fondly loſt.</p>
               <p>The Shepherdeſſe hauing made an ende of her ſharpe anſwer, and <hi>Feliſmena</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to arbitrate the matter between them; they heard a great noiſe in the other ſide of the meadow, like to the ſounde of blowes, and ſmiting of ſwordes vpon har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neies, as if ſome armed men had fought togither, ſo that all of them with great haſte ranne to the place, where they heard the noiſe, to ſee what the matter was. And being come ſomewhat neere, they ſaw in a little Iland, (which the riuer with a round turning had made) three knights fighting againſt one. And although he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelfe valiantly, by ſhewing his approoued ſtrength and courage, yet the three knights gaue him ſo much to do, that he was faine to helpe himſelfe by all the force and pollicie he could. They fought on foote, for their horſes were tied to little trees, that grew thereabouts. And now by this time, the knight that ſought all alone and defended himſelfe, had laide one of them at his feete with a blowe of his good ſword, which ended his life: But the other two that were very ſtrong and valiant, redoubled their force and blowes ſo thicke on him, that he looked for no other thing then death. The Shepherdeſſe <hi>Filiſmena</hi> ſeeing the knight in ſo great <pb n="158" facs="tcp:23115:84"/>danger, and if ſhe did not ſpeedily helpe him, that he could not eſcape with life, was not afraide to put hers in ieopardy, by doing that, which in ſuch a caſe ſhe thought, ſhe was bound to performe: wherefore putting a ſharpe headed arrowe into her bowe, ſhee ſaide vnto them: Keepe out knights, for it is not beſeeming men that make account of this name and honour, to take aduantage of their enimies with ſo great oddes. And ayming at the ſight of one of their helmets, ſhe burſt it with ſuch force, that the arrow running into his eies, came out of the other ſide of his head, ſo that he fell downe dead to the ground. When the diſtreſſed knight ſawe two of his enimies dead, he ran vpon the third with ſuch force, as if he had but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the combat; but <hi>Feliſmena</hi> helped him out of that trouble, by putting another arrow into her bow, the which tranſpiercing his armour, ſhe left vnder his left pap, and ſo iuſtly ſmot his hart, that this knight alſo followed his two companions. When the Shepherds and the knight beheld what
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> had done, and how at two ſhootes ſhe had killed two ſuch valiant knights, they were all in great woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The knight therefore taking off his helmet, and comming vnto her ſaide. How am I able (faire Shepherdeſſe) to requite ſo great a benefite, and good turne, as I haue receiued at thy hands this day, but by acknowledging this debt for euer in my gratefull minde. When <hi>Feliſmena</hi> beheld the knights face, and knew him, her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſo troubled, that being in ſuch a traunce ſhe could ſcarce ſpeake, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to her-ſelfe againe, ſhe anſwered him. Ah my <hi>Don Felix,</hi> this is not the firſt debt, wherein thou art bound vnto me. And I cannot beleeue, that thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this (as thou ſaieſt) no more then thou haſt done greater then this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Beholde to what a time and ende my fortune and thy forgetneſſe hath brought me, that ſhe that was woont to be ſerued of thee in the citie with Tilt and Tourneyes, and honoured with many other things, whereby thou didſt deceiue me, (or I ſuffered my ſelfe to be deceiued) doth nowe wander vppe and downe, exiled from her natiue countrey and libertie, for vſing thus thine owne. If this brings thee not into the knowledge of that which thou oweſt me, remember how one whole yeere I ſerued thee as thy page in the Princeſſe
<hi>Ceſarinas</hi> Court: and how I was a ſolicitor againſt my ſelfe, without diſcouering my ſelfe, or my thoughts vnto thee, but onley to procure thy remedie, and to helpe the greefe, which thine made thee feele. How many times did I get thee fauours from thy miſtreſſe <hi>Celia</hi> to the great coſt of my teares and greefes: all which account but ſmall
<hi>Don Felix</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe dangers (had they beene vnſufficient) wherein I would haue ſpent my life for redreſſe of thy paines, which thy iniurious loue affoorded thee. And vnleſſe thou art weary of the great loue, that I haue borne thee, conſider and weigh with thy ſelfe the ſtrange effects, which the force of loue hath cauſed me to paſſe. I went out of my natiue countrey, and came to ſerue thee, to lament the ill that thou did'ſt ſuffer, to take vpon me the iniuries and diſgraces that I receiued therein; and to giue thee any content, I cared not to lead the moſt bitter and painefull life, that euer woman liued. In the habite of a tender and daintie Ladie I loued thee more then thou canſt imagine, and in the habite of a baſe page I ſerued thee (a thing more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to my reſt and reputation then I meane now to reherſe) and yet now in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of a poore and ſimple Shepherdeſſe I came to do thee this ſmall ſeruice. What remaines then more for me to doe, but to ſacrifice my life to thy loueleſſe ſoule, if with the ſame yet, I could giue thee more content: and if in lieu therof thou wouldeſt but remember, how much I haue loued, &amp; do yet loue thee: here haſt thou thy ſword in thy hand; let none therefore, but thy ſelfe reuenge the offence that I haue done <pb n="159" facs="tcp:23115:84"/>thee. When the Knight heard
<hi>Feliſmenas</hi> words, and knew them all to be as true as he was diſloyall, his hart by this ſtrange &amp; ſudden accident recouered ſome force againe to ſee what great iniurie he had done her, ſo that the thought thereof, and the plenteous effuſion of blood that iſſued out of his woundes, made him like a dead man fall downe in a ſwoune at faire
<hi>Feliſmenas</hi> feete. Who with great care, and no leſſe feare, laying his head in her lap, with ſhowers of teares that rained from her eies, vpon the Knights pale viſage, began thus to lament. What meanes this cruell Fortune? Is the periode of my life come iuſt with the laſt ende of my
<hi>Don Felix</hi> his daies? Ah my <hi>Don Felix</hi> (the cauſe of all my paine) if the plenteous teares, which for thy ſake I haue ſhed, are not ſufficient: and theſe which I now diſtill vpon thy louely cheekes, too fewe to make thee come to thy ſelfe againe, what remedie ſhall this miſerable ſoule haue to preuent, that this bitter ioy by ſeeing thee, turne not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to occaſion of vtter deſpaire. Ah my <hi>Don Felix,</hi> Awake my loue, if thou doſt but ſleepe, or beeſt in a traunce, although I would not woonder if thou doſt not, ſince ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any thing that I could do, preuailed with thee to frame my leaſt content. And in theſe and other lamentations was faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> plunged, whom the Portugall Shepherdeſſes with their teares and poore ſupplies, endeuored to incourage, when on the ſudden they ſaw a faire Nymph comming ouer the ſtony cauſey that lead the way into the Ilande, with a golden bottel in one hand, &amp; a ſiluer one in the other, whom <hi>Feliſmena</hi> knowing by and by, ſaide vnto her. Ah <hi>Doria,</hi> could any come at this time to ſuccour me, but thou faire Nymph? Come hither then, &amp; thou ſhalt ſee the cauſe of al my troubles, the ſubſtance of my ſighs, &amp; the obiect of my thoughts, lying in the greateſt danger of death that may be. In like occurrents (ſaide <hi>Doria</hi>) vertue and a good hart muſt take place. Recall it then (faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) and reuiue thy daunted ſpirits, trouble not thy ſelfe any more, for nowe is the ende of thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and the beginning of thy contentment come. And ſpeaking theſe wordes, ſhe beſprinkled his face with a certaine odoriferous water which ſhe brought in the ſiluer bottle, whereby he came to his memorie againe, and then ſaide vnto him. If thou wilt recouer thy life, Sir Knight, and giue it her that hath paſſed ſuch an ill one for thy ſake, drinke of the water in this bottle: The which <hi>Don Felix</hi> taking in his hande, drunke a good draught, and reſting vpon it a little, founde himſelfe ſo whole of his wounds, which the three knights had giuen him, and of that, which the loue of <hi>Celia</hi> had made in his breſt, that now he felt the paine no more, which either of them had cauſed in him, then if he had neuer had them. And in this ſort he began to rekindle the old loue, that he bare to
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> the which (he thought) was neuer more zealous then now. Whereupon ſitting downe vpon the greene graſſe, hee tooke his Lady and Shepherdeſſe by the hands, and kiſſing them manie times ſaide thus vnto her. How ſmall account would I make of my life (my deereſt
<hi>Feliſmena</hi>) for cancelling that great bond, wherein (with more then life) I am for euer bound vnto thee: for ſince I enioy it by thy means, I thinke it no more then right, to reſtore thee that, which is thine owne. With what eies can I behold thy peereleſſe beauty, which (though vnaduiſedly) I knew not to be ſuch, yet how dare I (for that which I owe thee) caſt them in any other part? What wordes are ſufficient to excuſe the faults, that I haue committed againſt thy faith, and firmeſt loue, and loyaltie? Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and accurſed for euer ſhall I be, if thy condition and clemencie be not encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to my fauour, and pardon: for no ſatisfaction can ſuffice for ſo great an offence, nor reaſon to excuſe me for that, which thou haſt to forget me. Truth it is, that I loued <hi>Celia</hi> well, and forgot thee, but not in ſuch ſort that thy wiſedome and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <pb n="160" facs="tcp:23115:85"/>did euer ſlide out of my minde. And the beſt is, that I knowe not wherein to put this fault, that may be ſo iuſtly attributed to me; for if I will impute it to the yoong age that I was then in, ſince I had it to loue thee, I ſhoulde not haue wanted it to haue beene firme in the faith that I owed thee. If to <hi>Celias</hi> beautie, it is cleere, that thine did farre excell hers and all the worlds beſides. If to the change of time, this ſhoulde haue beene the touchſtone which ſhould haue ſhewed the force and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of my firmenes. If to iniurious and trayterous abſence, it ſerues as little for my excuſe, ſince the deſire of ſeeing thee ſhould not haue been abſent from ſupporting thy image in my memorie. Behold then <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> what aſſured truſt I put in thy goodnes, that (without any other meanes) I dare put before thee, the ſmall reaſon thou haſt to pardone me. But what ſhall I doe to purchaſe pardon at thy gracious hands, or after thou haſt pardoned me, to beleeue, that thou art ſatisfied: for one thing greeues me more then any thing elſe in the world, and this it is. That, though the loue which thou haſt borne me, and wherewith thou doſt yet bleſſe me, is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion (perhaps) to make thee forgiue me, and forget ſo many faults: yet I ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer lift vp mine eies to behold thee, but that euerie iniurie, which I haue done thee, will be worſe then a mortal inciſion in my guiltie hart. The Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> who ſaw <hi>Don Felix</hi> ſo penitent for his paſſed miſdeedes, and ſo affectionately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his firſt thoughts, with many teares told him, that ſhe did pardon him, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the loue, that ſhe had euer borne him, would ſuffer her to do no leſſe: which if ſhe had not thought to do, ſhe would neuer haue taken ſo great paines and ſo many wearie iourneyes to ſeeke him out, and many other things, wherewith <hi>Don Felix</hi> was confirmed in his former loue. Whereupon the faire Nymph <hi>Doria</hi> came then to the Knight, and after many louing words and courteous offers in the Ladie <hi>Felicias</hi> behalfe paſſed betweene them, ſhe requeſted him and faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> to goe with her to <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, where the ſage Ladie (with great deſire to ſee them) was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their comming. <hi>Don Felix</hi> agreed thereunto, and taking their leaue of the Portugall Shepherdeſſes (who wondered not a little to ſee what had happened) and of the woefull Shepherd
<hi>Danteus,</hi> mounting vpon the horſes of the dead Knights that were ſlaine in the late combate, they went on their waie. And as they were going,
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> told <hi>Don Felix</hi> with great ioy, what ſhe had paſt ſince ſhe had laſt ſeene him, which made him to maruell verie much, and eſpecially at the death of the three Sauages, and at the Palace of the ſage Ladie <hi>Felicia,</hi> and ſucceſſe of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Shepherdeſſes, and at euerie thing elſe contained in this booke. And
<hi>Don Felix</hi> wondred not a little to vnderſtand how his Ladie
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> had ſerued him ſo many daies as his page, and that he was ſo far gon out of his wits and memorie, that he knew her not all that while. And his ioy on the other ſide, to ſee that his Ladie loued him ſo well, was ſo great, that by no meanes he could hide it. Thus therefore riding on their way, they came to <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, where the ſage
<hi>Felicia</hi> was looking for their comming: and likewiſe the Shepherd
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> and <hi>Beliſa, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia,</hi> who were now come thither not many daies before. They were welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med on euerie ſide, &amp; with great ioy intertained; but faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> eſpecially, who for hir rare vertues and ſingular beautie was greatly honored of them all. There they were all married with great ioy, feaſts, and triumphes, which were made by all the goodly Nymphes, and by the ſage and noble Ladie <hi>Felicia;</hi> the which <hi>Syrenus</hi> with his comming augmented not a little, of whom, &amp; of the Portugall Shepherds
<hi>Danteus,</hi> and <hi>Duarda,</hi> more ſhall be ſpoken in the ſecond part of this booke.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough it was not otherwiſe poſſible, but that the ioy of theſe happie Louers was very great, ſince fortune had now lifted them vp to ſo high a degree of content, and happines, as they themſelues could not wiſh for more, (euery one poſſeſſing his onely deſire) yet I thinke that <hi>Felicias</hi> was not any whit leſſe then theirs, by ſeeing her ſelfe viſited by ſo worthie a companie, and that by her onely meanes they enioyed ſuch wiſhed reſt: And the rather, for that ſhe was more capable to feele this ioy, by reaſon of the excellencie of her wit, the mature iudgement whereof, the more it was higher then theirs, the more it made the internall powers and workes of the ſoule more perfect and abſolute. So that if the ſage Lady had onely regarded her pleaſure and content (forgetting what was conueeient for euery one of them) ſhe would not haue requeſted them to come to her Palace againe: but being ſo carefull for thoſe things, which were moſt needefull for them, by neglecting her owne will and deſire, ſhe prouided for euery one in particular. Whereupon (certaine daies being paſt, in which ſhe had entertained them with moſt royall and ſumptuous feaſtes, and ſmall they were not, ſince ſhe was mightier in operations then others in imaginations) ſhe bethought her of <hi>Arſileus,</hi> and of his deere loue <hi>Beliſa,</hi> and therewithall remembred how needefull it was for them to goe viſit and comfort their aged parents, who paſſed many a doubtfull and ſorrowfull thought for them, <hi>Arſenius</hi> eſpecially father vnto <hi>Arſileus,</hi> whom ſhe had now remedied and rid from the loue, which ſo lately had made him dote on faire <hi>Beliſa.</hi> Who therefore giuing the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> infinite thankes for the benefites, and louing entertainment they had receiued at her handes, and taking their leaue of the Lordes, Ladies, Nymphes, and Shepherdes that were there, the next day following went to their owne towne. And not many daies after,
<hi>Felicia</hi> one night after ſupper ſaide thus to <hi>Syluanus</hi> and
<hi>Seluagia.</hi> I could not chooſe but blame you fortunate Shepherdes, for the ſmall care you haue of your flockes, if I my ſelfe were not in fault, bicauſe you haue neuer asked after them in all this time, nor (I thinke) once remembred them, fearing leſt by reaſon of your abſence, they haue beene in great want, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, being not carried to feede at conuenient times vpon the greene and ſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie graſſe, nor (at their neede) driuen to the cleere ſprings to quench their burning thirſt, nor with wonted loue put into the coole and pleaſant ſhades: And ſeeing that with familiar and gentle hand they are not eaſed of the burden of their fruitfull bags, that ſwell with abundance of white milke, and that with the accuſtomed and knowen voice of their louing Shepherds they are not called to licke the ſmooth peebles of the ſauourie ſalt; nor that your ſweete Bagpipes (ſeconded with many amorous Ditties, which not long ſince made there the woods and dales to ring) <pb n="162" facs="tcp:23115:86"/>haue ſounded in their eares: It is therefore conuenient that to morrow you depart at the riſing of purple <hi>Aurora</hi> the foreteller of ſpeedie <hi>Phebus,</hi> whereof I put you in minde, at this time eſpecially, bicauſe your abſence from them before was not ſo great, that you needed to be told thereof. Which departure of yours I woulde not haue you thinke is to any other ende, but to ſet ſome order in your affaires, that at your pleaſure you may the ſooner returne hither againe, aſſuring you that elſewhere you ſhall not be better entertained with deedes, then heere with hart and good will. And your returne ſhall onely be to ſolace your ſelues in the companie of <hi>Don Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> whoſe time is not yet come to depart. Wherefore I pray you goe about it, for ſetting all things in good order touching your flockes and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall affaires, you may doe the other the better; yet promiſing you, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you come to your dwelling places, you ſhall finde thoſe that can looke well to your flockes, if you will at the leſt commit them to their charge: and who will moſt willingly take it vpon them. Let your returne (therefore) be with as much ſpeede as may be, which ſhall reſult to your owne profite, and to their pleaſure with whom you ſhail paſſe away the time heere. <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> had their eies ſo faſtened on the maieſticall countenance of the Sage Lady, perceiuing her ſpeech to be onely addreſſed to them, that with great reuerence they roſe out of their places, and gaue a diligent eare vnto her, bicauſe they might better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande the meaning and effect thereof. For otherwiſe ſeldome were their eies ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into any other part, but to looke vpon one another, vnable to remooue them (the leaſt time that might be) from thence, wherein each others ſoule had no ſmall portion, and thinking it ſtealth, to remooue their thoughts from that entire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, whereof their mutuall harts had ſo ſure poſſeſſion. Whereupon the ſage Ladies ſpeech being ended, both of them turned their amorous eies to each other againe, <hi>Syluanus</hi> making louing ſignes to
<hi>Seluagia</hi> to anſwer the Ladies intent. To whom with a ſeemly bluſh, as partly aſhamed thereat, ſhe ſaide in this ſort. It is now no time (my deere <hi>Syluanus</hi>) to vſe circumſtances of ſuch arte, when there is no cauſe, neither doe they well beſeeme this place. For though their vſage to all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is commendable, yet not in particular, for the husband to his wife, and in ſuch ſort as if he went about to preferre her before himſelfe. For after that the woman hath deliuered herſelfe into the poſſeſſion of her husband, ſhe therewithal yeeldeth vp to his iuriſdiction the title of her libertie, by the ſweete and ſacred bonde of marriage. Whereupon I ſhall ſee the loue thou beareſt me, if thou vſeſt this pleaſant bonde according to the iuſt lawes thereof, by ſetting aſide the ſuperſtitious vanities of vnlawfull and wanton loue.
<hi>Syluanus</hi> had not let <hi>Seluagia</hi> eſcaped ſo ſmoothly without an anſwer, if he had not thought it an vndecent part to defer his to the ſage Lady. Wherfore giuing a becke with his head to his Shepherdeſſe in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of thanks, and that he was well pleaſed, with her louing words, he anſwered <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> thus. Preſuppoſing (ſage Lady) that we muſt do all that you commaund and ſet downe, and that there is nothing more behoouefull for our welfare, then your will, and pleaſure, therein it lies to command vs whatſoeuer, I feeling no greater reprehenſion in mine owne behalfe, then that which proceedes from your wiſe and louing aduiſe, ſaying, that I haue no care of my flocks, nor thought of them at all: For though (I confeſſe) I haue not remembred them as reaſon woulde I had done, yet cannot I therefore be iuſtly blamed, but rather thinke, that if I had done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I might haue beene in greater fault. For it were not meete, ſince I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch benefits in your houſe, that I ſhoulde forget one minute, that ioy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:23115:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>wherewith ſuch ſweete and pleaſant thoughts are ingendred and preſerued, to thinke vpon thoſe flockes that feede vpon the vnſauorie graſſe. And you may alſo beleeue, that if my fewe and ſilly ſheepe, nay if the whole worlde ſhould periſh, and be loſt, and that if it lay in my hands to helpe them both, in reſpect of employing my high and happy thoughts (the leaſt time that might be) on my faire and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Shepherdeſſe, my ſheepe ſhould remaine without helpe, and the world without ſuccour. <hi>Seluagia</hi> that was not vnskilfull in paying ſuch debts with like coine again, an ſwered him thus. As it lieth not in me, (my deere friend) ſo will I not find fault with any thing thou doſt: which I ſpeake to this end, bicauſe thou ſhouldeſt not vſe (as I told thee before) any more words ſo apparantly manifeſting that loue, whereof I doubt not: Although there is nothing (if I muſt tell the truth, after the glorie that I haue conceiued in my ioyfull thoughts by being thine) that can pleaſe and content me more then to ſee, how farre by wordes and effect thy true loue extendeth. For though ſome ſay, That where deedes be, wordes are in vaine, yet I take great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing them, when they are by all probabilitie correſpondent vnto deedes, and eſpecially in matters of loue, whereof we now talke. For ſince the interiour part is a hidden and ſecret thing, and which is ſooneſt diſcouered by wordes, wee muſt therefore not meanely account of them, that pretend to make the interiour knowne by th'exteriour. True it is that ſuch words and outward actes muſt be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the effects of him that pronounceth them. For oftentimes we ſee that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things are vttred by a falſe and deceitfull toong, which were neuer ment in the hart. Which I ſpeake not in preiddice of thy loue (my deere Shepherd) or to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thee of diſloyaltie, aſſuring that I am glad to heare thy words, whereby (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the certaintie that I haue of thy trueſt loue) thou makeſt me the moſt conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted woman in the world. And in this I take no ſmall glory, and that thy loue (not able to containe it ſelfe within the ſoule) flowes out by the mouth, like the little pot which filled with water is hardly ſet on the fire without running ouer. And bicauſe thou maiſt not thinke to ouercome me in affection, I would wiſh that as loue hath giuen me deedes, it had alſo lent me ſome wordes, to make a full ſatisfaction of thoſe true ſignes of thy vnfained good will, which hath brought me ſo much in thy debt. But ſince they are ſo ſtrange vnto mee, I muſt, with onely offring that which I am able to giue, endeuour to diſcharge my ſelfe thereof. They all tooke great delight to heare what amorous wordes paſſed betweene the Shepherdes, which had not ended ſo ſoone, if <hi>Felicia</hi> had not cut them off, ſaying: That ſince the one was ſatisfied and content with the others anſwere, their comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould now ceaſe, and turning to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſhe ſaid. And thinke not (free Shepherd) that I haue forgotten thee, for thou ſhalt hereafter ſee woonders at my hands. I know not any thing good Ladie (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) wherein I may truely ſay you haue forgotten me, ſince you haue made me ſo much remember my ſelfe, that with cleere eies I may eaſily diſcerne, not only my follies paſt; but alſo thoſe which theſe Gentlemen and ſhepherds are ſo fondly fallen into. Euerie one laughed at <hi>Syrenus</hi> words, to whom <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaid. In ſooth
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> all are of thy opinion, if not, aske thy corriuall
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> and his beloued <hi>Seluagia.</hi> The blind man (anſwered
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not iudge of colours. Whom wilt thou haue then for iudge (ſaid <hi>Felicia?</hi>) Him (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) that hath the eies of reaſon. And who is he, ſaid <hi>Felicia?</hi> If there be no other (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) my ſelfe. So wouldeſt thou giue ſentence (ſaid
<hi>Felicia</hi>) in thine owne fauour; but knoweſt thou not, that the iudge is not admitted, when he is not free from paſſion? But I am (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus.</hi>) Otherwiſe (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) thy iudgement would not <pb n="164" facs="tcp:23115:87"/>be allowed. Not for me at the leaſt (ſaide
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) though it be for others. Let vs leaue this for ſome fitter time (ſaid <hi>Felicia.</hi>) And <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> thou ſhalt to morrow ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> home, bicauſe thou cameſt in their company hither, but with condition (as theirs is) of thy ſpeedie returne againe. <hi>Syrenus</hi> anſwered, that it pleaſed him well. It is well then, ſaid <hi>Felicia:</hi> and therfore let vs go take our reſt with ſome parting ſong to the tune of thy free Rebecke, and
<hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> with their enamoured Bagpipes ſhall anſwer thee. Then did <hi>Syluanus</hi> take his Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe for
<hi>Syrenus</hi> to ſing to it, and <hi>Syrenus</hi> his Rebecke to play to
<hi>Syluanus</hi> when he had done. And ſo <hi>Syrenus</hi> leading the ſong, began thus.</p>

               <p>They maruelled not a little at the ſweetenes of his ſong, &amp; were no leſſe ſorrie, bicauſe they knew not what Shepherd he was; but ſeeing it was not then poſſible to know him, they went on their nigheſt waies. Some haſte they made to paſſe away the heate of the day in that Iland, where they found the deſperate Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſa,</hi> taking the ſame to be a more freſh and pleaſant place, and more quiet for their recreation then any other. Whereunto being come, they ſaw how a little brooke, couered almoſt all ouer with ſweet and ſmelling herbs, ranne gently thorow a little greene meadow amongſt a ranke of diuers trees, that were nouriſhed and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the cleere water; vnder the ſhadowes of which, as they were now determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to reſt themſelues, <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaid. Let vs ſee (if you thinke good) from whence this little ſpring doth iſſue foorth: It may be the place is more freſh and cooler therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; if not, or if we cannot finde out the fountaine, from whence it flowes, we will come hither againe. It liked his company well, and ſo they deſired him to leade the way. Euerie place and part, that all the brooke vpwards they troad on, inuited them to pleaſant reſt, being all alike to the verie fountaine, whereupon <hi>Seluagia</hi> ſaid. If we cannot finde out the beginning of this ſpring, we ſhall not finde (at the leaſt) any diſcontent for our ſelues, or ſuffer any trouble in returning backe againe, ſince ſo conuenient places (as better, and more pleaſant we cannot wiſh for our deſired reſt) in going vp higher, are offered vnto vs. Hauing now gone vp a little along the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brooke, and not found out the head, and that euerie ſtep (as I ſaid) preſented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a pleaſant place of reſt, they went ſtaying ſomtimes, &amp; ſomtimes reaſoning with themſelues, where they might ſit, one of them ſaying: This place is more freſh: and another anſwering, no, but this, let vs ſit downe heere, for this is more pleaſant: no, but here (ſaid another:) So that the pleaſant obiect of euerie place held them in ſuch ſuſpence, that none of them could chooſe out the beſt. But reſoluing at the laſt vpon one, they tooke the ſcrips of their ſhoulders, and paſſing their ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hookes from their left hands, they tooke them in their right to lay them downe to reſt, when they ſaw, that with greater quantitie of waters and freſher ſhades of green trees the brooke ranne vp higher; ſo that for a new hope, a new aire and place was <pb n="171" facs="tcp:23115:90"/>obiected to them. They had not yet ſcarce begun to goe vp a little farther, when the brooke forſaking her right courſe towardes the left hand, made them turne their ſteps backe againe, where they diſcouered a great thicket, and ſpring of diuers trees. Comming to the which, they ſaw a very narrow entrance, and ſomwhat long, whoſe ſides were not of wals fabricated by artificiall hand, but made of trees by nature (the miſtreſſe of all things:) ſo that the wooddy place was no leſſe enobled and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliſhed with the naturall verdure, then the ſtately chambers with emboſſed gold. For there was ſeene the deadly Cypreſſe, the triumphant Laurell, the hard Oke, the low ſallow, the inuincible palme, the blacke and ruggie Elme, the Oliue, the prickie Cheſtenut, &amp; the high Pineapple, one amongſt another; whoſe bodies were bound about with greene Iuie and the fruitfull vine, and beſet with ſweet Ieſmines &amp; many other redolent flowers, that grew very thicke togither in that place. Amongſt the which many little birds (inhabitants of that wood) went leaping from bough to bough, as in ſcornefull cages, making the place more pleaſant with their ſweete and ſiluer notes. The trees were in ſuch order ſet togither, that they denied not the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſunbeames to haue an entrance in betweene the boughes and leaues, to paint forth the greene ground with diuers colours, which reuerberated from the flowers, that were neuer ſteadie in one place, by reaſon that the mooueable leaues did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them. This narrow way did alſo lead to a little greene, couered all ouer with fine graſſe, and not touched with the hungrie mouthes of deuouring flockes. At the ſide of it, was the fountaine of the brooke, hauing a care, that that place ſhould not drie vp, ſending forth on euerie ſide her flowing waters. The water of this cleere fountaine came out of a ſtony rocke, which a great Oke with his hard rootes did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, on either ſide whereof ſtood two great Laurell trees. This fountaine did riſe towards that place, where the ſunne beginnes to mount, declining ſomewhat to the ſeptentrionall part. The ſame rockie ſtone, whereby the water ranne out, ſerued both for a mouth and channell, which was not wrought with the blow of the hard Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil; but by the continuall running of the gentle water: and ſo it was in ſome places a little more worne, then in others, being more ſoft, or (to ſay more properly) leſſe hard in one place then in another; and by reaſon of the concauitie of the ſtone, there was ſeene an inequalitie, that repreſented a more pleaſant and gracious running, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it made the water come out more merily with high and low fals, repreſenting certaine criſtalline in cleeres, and ſhadows, a pleaſant and delightfull ſight to the greedie eie. The water fell into a fountaine of the ſame rockie ſtone, wrought after the ſame forme, as the channell was: It was foureſquare, and euery ſide was fower foote in bredth, and in depth ſixe or a little more. The Petrenall was not right, to ſmite fire with the blowe of hard ſteele, bicauſe it was not blacke, but ſo white, that had it not beene for the hardnes thereof, none would haue thought, but that it had beene Alablaſter. And though it was not ſo curiouſly cut out, and wrought like marble, yet was it maruellous and ſtrange for the turne it ſerued. And ſo for the clecrenes of the water, as alſo for the whitenes of the rockie ſtone it was ſo chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, that if any foule thing did fall therein, it was ſo apparant to his ſight that came thither, that (maugre his will) hee was forced not to ſuffer it to receiue ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, but to bring it againe to the former purenes: For which cauſe it was euer kept verie cleere, and cleane. The water ranne out of it into an Ilande on both ſides, to enuironne the greene plat, which was ſet round about with white Poplars, blacke Elmes, and greene Sallowes. It was in length about a hundred and fiftie paces, and a hundred and twentie in bredth. There was no entrance into <pb n="172" facs="tcp:23115:91"/>it, but where the Shepheds went in, and by another way right ouer againſt the ſame, made almoſt in the ſelfe ſame forme and faſhion: for the thicknes of the trees ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp all other waies, and alſo bicauſe the water that ranne by the ſides, iſſuing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſide without in ſome places of that brooke, did wax ſo broad between the place of the trees, that by the playne it could not, by reaſon that it was ſomewhat higher. Neere to this fountaine did the Shepherds ſit vnder the ſhadow of a braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie Oke, and certaine Laurell trees, and taking out ſome of thoſe victuals that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> had prouided for them (after they had reſted themſelues a little) they ouercame their importunate hunger, ſatisfying their appetites ſufficiently with the ſame: and bicauſe they had a good way to goe that day, they tooke not their reſt, as much as the place and their deſires did inuite them; but before all the heate of the day was paſt (leaſt the time ſhould alſo paſſe away with it) they were about to goe from that place. But as they were preparing themſelues to riſe, and to be gone, <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaide to
<hi>Syluanus.</hi> It is not reaſon <hi>Syluanus,</hi> that, liuing now in ſuch ioy and content, and in the preſence of thy beloued <hi>Seluagia,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt let thy Bagpipe waxe ſo drie; nor, is it meete, that from this pleaſant place (the friendly entertainment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights whereof thou haſt enioyed) thou ſhouldeſt depart, without requiting it with the ſweetnes of thy melodie, and ſong. With greater reaſon (anſwered
<hi>Syluanus</hi>) ſhould the <hi>Hamadryades</hi> preſeruers of theſe trees, and the <hi>Driades</hi> inhabitours of theſe green woods complaine of thee, that wouldeſt go away, without giuing them ſome part of thy ſweete harmonie, and melodious voice. Let vs leaue this courteous contention (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) and doe that which I requeſt thee, for the great reaſon which thou haſt to do it for that which I told thee firſt, though thou wilt not (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) for that, which I alleaged laſt. For the firſt indeed I cannot deny thee ſaid <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus,</hi> but in faith I know not what to ſing, that might not grieue thee, that art ſo far from loue, or offend me that am ſo full of amorous thoughts, ſo that in the end I can ſing nothing (vnleſſe it be to mine owne griefe) but that which belongs thereunto. To heare thy delicate ſongs, and inioy the ſweetnes of thy voice (ſaide, <hi>Syrenus</hi>) I will be content with any thing: but ſince it muſt needes be in ſuch ſort, in thy ſong I pray thee ſhew, how far the firmnenes of thy loue extendeth, which thou beareſt to thy louing Shepherdeſſe; for by occaſion heereof I know ſhe cannot, nor will not chooſe but anſwere thee againe, in whoſe ſweet voice and ſong I ſhall take no leſſe delight, then in thine.

               <p>The Shepherds hauing made an end of their ſweete ſongs, roſe vp, and caſting their hairy ſcrippes on their ſhoulders, ſtaying themſelues vpon their knotty ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooks, began to go on their way. Who being comen out of that pleaſant place into a faire meade, to paſſe the time away, and lighten their trauell and length of their way, went inuenting and exerciſing diuers paſtorall ſports, of which they made
<hi>Seluagia</hi> iudge betweene them both; ſometimes throwing with their ſlings at ſome white or marke, that they could eſpie within their reach vpon the ſide of ſome hill or tree; ſometimes trying with great dexteritie the goodnes of their ſlings, to ſee, who coulde giue the greateſt cracke with them; ſometimes ſtriuing who coulde throwe his Sheepehooke fartheſt; ſometimes contending to pitch them neereſt to ſome white, or Daiſie in the way before them, and whether of them with the ſtrength of his arme could come nigheſt to ſome other marke, as farre as they could reach; and ſometimes ſtriuing who could ſmite a ſtone fardeſt with them. In this ſort they paſſed the time and wearines of their way, vntill the broade mantell of the darke night beginning to ouerſpred thoſe plaines and fieldes, made an ende of their ſports, and warned them to take their reſt, where they lodged that night. The next day in the morning betimes, when the prety birdes with their warbling notes filling the aire (not yet fully cleere) with harmonie, foretold the comming of the Vermillion morning, they began to make an end of their former iourney. And now did the ſunne caſt downe his beames hotter vpon their heads, and with greater heate ſhewing his forces, when the three Shepherds came in ſight of their knowne fieldes, and plaines, ſo often troden of them before. Whereupon they now began to know their wandring flockes, and amongſt thoſe
<hi>Dianas</hi> ſheepe, although they were mingled with the flockes of her vnwoorthy husband <hi>Delius:</hi> And ſo as <hi>Sylua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> was ſaying, (Theſe are the flockes of the vngratefull and diſdainfull Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe
<hi>Diana,</hi> and of the Shepherd <hi>Delius,</hi> happie without deſert)
<hi>Seluagia</hi> ſaide. It is not good to go by and not ſalute
<hi>Diana,</hi> if we finde her there: And ſo they went that way to ſeeke her out, where they had not gone farre, but they ſawe her ſtanding
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:23115:92"/>very ſadde, and leaning againſt a great Oke with her elbow vpon her ſheepehooke, and her cheeke vpon the palme of her hande, whereby one might haue iudged the care and ſorrow that ſo much troubled her penſiue minde. After a little while (as though ſhe was angrie with herſelfe for caſting her-ſelfe into ſo great a greefe) ſhe put her hand into her boſome, and tooke out a fine little Baggepipe, the which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to her mouth to play on it, in that very inſtant, ſhe threwe it to the ground, and without more adoe, ſliding downe along the bodie of the tree, ſat her downe, as if for great feeblenes ſhe had not beene able to ſtaie herſelfe on her feete, and caſting out a ſorrowfull ſigh, and looking vpon her harmleſſe Baggepipe, ſhe ſpake theſe words. Accurſed Baggepipe, conſuming fire burne thee, for the greefe and anguiſh that thou haſt giuen me. I brought thee with me to lighten and aſſwage my cruell ſorrow, in which dutie thou haſt not onely failed, but redoubled it the more. Thou ſhalt not then accompanie me any more, for the ill requitall of that loue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I did euer cheriſh thee. Now I am not any more for thee, nor thou to ſerue my turne: There ſhalt thou lie for the parching ſunne to open thee, making thee as drie as I am comfortleſſe; and for the raine to rotte thee, making thee as moiſt as my cheekes, ſpunged with continuall teares. Ah woe is me, how am I deceiued, in thinking that the ſilly and ſenceleſſe Baggepipe is in fault of that, which enuious Fortune hath made me feele, and in forgetting (being ſo skilfull in other things) how more abundantly my fortune ſurchargeth my ſoule with paine and troubles, then this poore Baggepipe with any fault or iniurie? How do I afflict and moleſt my ſelfe for a ſmal cauſe, hauing ſo many to wearie me withall? O God, how comes it to paſſe, that the cauſe of my paſſed ioy and gladnes is now the occaſion of my preſent ſorrow, and that thoſe things, which before were light and eaſie, are now moſt greeuous torments and burdens to me? Howe ſoone is pleaſure exiled from my poore ſoule, wherein it was woont to make ſo ſweete a ſoiourne? In how ſhort a time haue I loſt my deere content, whylom my only &amp; truſtie companion? And how eaſily am I depriued of all ioy and happines, which I once ſo much at will poſſeſſed? To what end doth it auaile me to be endowed with beauty and wit (which with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie I may chalenge, ſince all do affirme the ſame in me) vnleſſe they were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to remooue ſome part of my greefe? But I beſeech the ſoueraigne Gods, that I were ſo farre from beautie and wit, as I am at this preſent from ioy and comfort, ſo that either the firſt had not brought me to this painfull condition of life, or want of the ſecond paſſed it away without feeling it ſo ſenſiblie. O <hi>Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Syluanus,</hi> how are yee now reuenged of me, although it be vnknowne to you, thou <hi>Syluanus</hi> of the contempt I did vniuſtly beare thee, &amp; thou <hi>Syrenus</hi> of the ill requitall I gaue thee for thy ſincere and earneſt loue. How neere (alas) doth the ſorrowfull memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of that ioyfull time come to my minde, that did ſo ſoone ſlide out of my hands? I would the Gods had beene ſo pitifull to me, at one and ſelfe-ſame time to haue ended my daies, and thoſe delightfull howers. When ſhe had ſpoken theſe words, ſhe gaue ſo great a ſobbe, and ſuch vehement ſighes, that it ſeemed ſhe had no more life left to animate her afflicted and feeble body. <hi>Syrenus</hi> his libertie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuion, and <hi>Syluanus</hi> his new content were not ſo great, but that their harts did melt with pitie at <hi>Dianas</hi> ſorrowfull words and afflictions: for the paſſions and effects, which with her dolefull ſpeeches ſo liuely ſhe repreſented, were ſo manie, that might haue mooued the cruell Tygres to tendernes and compaſſion. In all this complaint ſhe ſpake not a worde almoſt, that was not accompanied with a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſigh. <hi>Seluagia</hi> therefore (who by experience knew well, how much a great <pb n="176" facs="tcp:23115:93"/>greefe aggrauateth the hart that ſuffers it) felt <hi>Dianas</hi> paine no leſſe, then both the Shepherds. But aboue all the reſt, a certaine Shepherd, who bicauſe he woulde not be ſeene, ſtoode cloſely behinde a great Oke, yet as neere vnto her as he could, to heare her the better, &amp; to ſee her face. The three Shepherds that were not far off, perceiued him, though he ſaw them not againe: And it was woorthy of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſee how aſtoniſhed he ſtoode at
<hi>Dianas</hi> beautie, augmented (if it might be) with the burning anger and anguiſh of her greeuous thoughts, and enameled with the criſtalline teares, which he ſawe trickle downe from her cleere eies vpon her Roſie cheekes; ſo that the Shepherd did neither ſtirre hand nor foote, nor did once put togither (a common and naturall thing in all men) his moouing eie-lids. But
<hi>Diana</hi> vnable to take ſome little reſt and eaſe in any place, riſing vp from the harde grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſhe went into thoſe buſhy thickets, next vnto hir, which was as great a griefe vnto the vnknowne Shepherd, as if his tender hart had been rent out of his panting breſt. For ſeeing
<hi>Diana</hi> gone, and that ſhe would not harken to his requeſt (for he praied her to ſtay a little longer) he made haſte to followe her: But thinking with himſelfe, that it contented her better to be alone, he went not after her, bicauſe he woulde not in any thing offende her, but ſitting downe againe, and taking out his Rebecke, he began to ſing this ſong following.</p>

               <p>They maruelled much at the Shepherdes new kinde of ſong, and how hee wreſted the ſelfe ſame words to fall in ryme, that were of different ſignifications: to whom at laſt they came, who, perceiuing he was eſpied, held his peace. And after they had ſaluted each other,
<hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaid. Whoſoeuer thou art iollie Shepherd, ſo may not thy louing flockes be deuoured of the hungrie wolues, nor want the ſweete and coole ſhades in burning ſummer, nor taſte of the foule waters in ſeeking out cleere ſtreames and fountaines, that thou wouldeſt hold on thy ſong: for this Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and faire Shepherdeſſe here ſhall plaie vnto thee, whoſe merie Bagpipes, and ſweete ſongs haue not once, but a hundred times ſtayed the nimble footed Faunes and Satyres in their ſwift flight, and made the faire Nymphes to come out of their greene arbours to liſten to them. Shepherd, ſaide <hi>Firmius</hi> againe (for this was his name) thy manner of adiuring me is but of little force, ſince it ſhall greeue me little or nothing whether my flockes be torne by rauening wolues, when deeper matters then theſe trouble my mind, which (more then deuouring wolues) teare my hart a ſunder. But yet for the reſpect which thou haſt told me of theſe Shepherds (which I beleeue no leſſe) I would be glad to giue you all the pleaſure I could, but ſince I haue it not my ſelfe, nor am deſirous to haue it in this ſort, it is impoſſible that you ſhould take any by my meanes; and the more, ſince by thoſe ſignes of ioye, that by their countenance may bee gathered, they haue little neede to borrowe it from him, that hath none at all. We will not denie (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) but that, which thou haſt ſaid, is true, that ſo much, and more readie we are to ſhew our ioye, as thou art to manifeſt thy ſorrow, which is not (by that we our ſelues haue ſeene) of many daies, nor howers continuance, bicauſe it ſeemes to bee (to ſpeake in plainer termes) for loue of the faire Shepherdeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> And if it be ſo, the ſorrow cannot be much, which in ſo ſmall a time cannot do any great harme. I will not deny Shepherdeſſe (ſaid <hi>Firmius</hi>) nor confeſſe vnto thee, that <hi>Dianas</hi> beautie hath deſtroyed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But admit ſhe were the cauſe thereof, thou haſt but little skill (it ſeemes) and leſſe experience in <hi>Cupides</hi> woundes; for thou ſayeſt that in a ſmall time a great wound cannot be made, as if it were needfull for loue to haue ſome longer time to make a deep &amp; perfect wound, to touch one to the quick. Thou knoweſt mine but a little (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) by not confeſſing, that it is not onely greater then thine, or any others that were euer borne. Thou hadſt not ſaid amiſſe (ſaid <hi>Firmius</hi>) if thou didſt adde (in thine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.) It needed not (ſaid
<hi>Seluagia.</hi>) and leſſe need haue I (ſaid <hi>Firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) by thy loue to know mine own, if (at the leaſt) I had any at al. By not confeſſing it (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) thou ſheweſt the litle intereſt thou haſt in loue: and perhaps the great propertie (ſaid
<hi>Firmius</hi>) that I haue in griefe and ſorrow, bicauſe I dare not tell it. Why (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) who doth hide the glorie of thy thoughts? My ſmall deſertes (ſaid <hi>Firmius.</hi>) So much the better (ſaid
<hi>Seluagia</hi>) bicauſe the glorie is greater. Nay the worſe for this (ſaid <hi>Firmius</hi>) bicauſe the fall ſhall be the greater. Thou art a great maſter of words (ſaid <hi>Seluagia.</hi>) Nay of workes (ſaid
<hi>Firmius.</hi>) I haue not ſeene them hitherto (ſaid <hi>Seluagia.</hi>) To this laſt <hi>Firmius</hi> would not anſwer againe: But
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> that maruelled all this while at the ſharpe and wittie anſwers of the vnknowen Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, put himſelfe betweene them both to ende this ſtrife, as alſo for that he ſaw <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus</hi> ſomewhat altered, ſeeing his Shepherdeſſe vrged ſo much, although he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly <pb n="178" facs="tcp:23115:94"/>tempered himſelfe with <hi>Firmius</hi> his moderate and mild anſwers, which made him hold his peace, which otherwiſe he would not haue done: wherefore <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaid. No more gentle Shepherds, as you loue your ſelues. Then <hi>Seluagia</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging her fault, and the modeſtie of the Shepherd, ſhe looked on him with a milde and ſober countenance, ſaying. Pardon me good Shepherd, for the force of my great loue vrged me to ſay thus much. But I (ſaid
<hi>Firmius</hi>) muſt rather craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for if there be any offence, it is of my ſide. I am glad (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) that you are friendes againe, and that you will not fall out for ſo ſmall a matter. I knewe thee
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) when once thou wouldeſt not iudge it ſo light a thing as now thou doſt. But of friendſhip Shepherd, (looking vpon <hi>Firmius</hi>) he ſaide, tell vs (ſince thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelfe ſo wiſe in euery thing) how that may be, which thou didſt ſay: That loue doth make his operations as perfect in a ſhort time, as in a longer: for (me thinkes) it ſhould be cleane contrarie to reaſon and experience, I meane, if it be not by ſome extraordinarie and ſecret ſcience, as <hi>Felicia</hi> doth, a Ladie not meanely experimented in thoſe operations. On the otherſide, I woulde faine know the cauſe thereof, if at leaſt there be any; for to make a change in our ſelues, (which is but an eaſie matter in compariſon) we muſt haue the helpe of ſome time, how much more then is it requiſite for ſo great a worke as that, which <hi>Cupid</hi> makes. In baſe and ſimple Cottages in my natiue fieldes (replied <hi>Firmius</hi>) I woulde haue thee alſo aske this queſtion, where ſo wiſe and learned a Shepherd abides, who is able, not onely to ſatisfie thy doubts heerein, but what elſe thou wouldſt deſire to knowe. But as concerning this matter, I remember I heard him ſay: That as the Sunne, when it appeeres, doth in the very point and inſtant powre downe all his brightnes without waſting any time, &amp; perfectly giues vs his light: So <hi>Cupid</hi> (whom he called the God of loue) when he takes poſſeſſion of the louers hart, doth in an inſtant with his full and abſolute force command and raigne there. This compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (ſaid
<hi>Syluanus</hi>) doth not like me ſo well. Why ſo, ſaid
<hi>Firmius?</hi> for according to the ſame (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) we ſhould all loue in equall proportion and degree, if loue with all his force in ſuch ſorte wounded euerie one, which I will not confeſſe. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd (ſaid <hi>Firmius</hi>) thou haſt ſo well touched the matter to the quicke, that I muſt needs yeeld my ſelfe ouercommed, and yet without ſhame, ſince the meaning ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of exceedes my paſtorall condition and conceit. But giue me leaue a little, and I will bethinke me (if I can remember) how he reſolued the like obiection. But this (I thinke) and the reſt is ſlid out of my memorie, and yet (me thinkes) I ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it, and haue it at my toongs end. And now I call it to minde, though I know not whether ſo well as he ſpake it. But howſoeuer it is, you muſt accept it in ſuch rude ſort, as I ſhall tell it you. He ſaid, if <hi>Cupid</hi> wrought more in one hart then in another, that this proceeded not of
<hi>Cupids</hi> part, who aſſailes all equallie, but of the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the hart, where he makes his impreſſion; and for this he brought a pretty compariſon. For with examples he made vs Countrey-fellowes vnderſtand this and manie other things, bicauſe by them we might remember the better what hee told vs. But the example was this. That as the Sunne or fire doth ſooner heat a piece of wood, then a ſtone (giuing as much heate to the one as to the other) bicauſe the wood is apter and better diſpoſed to receiue the heate, then the ſtone: ſo loue maketh a greater impreſſion in one hart then in another, by reaſon of the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of one, then of another. He added moreouer, that as the ſtone reſiſteth heate better then the wood; and after it is once hot, more hardly leeſeth that heat, then the wood, which more eaſily receiued it: ſo he, that moſt reſiſteth loue, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="179" facs="tcp:23115:94"/>after ſubiect vnto it, with greater <hi>difficultie</hi> deliuers himſelfe, then he who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe but eaſily to be ouercommed by it. And with this aske me no more of this matter: for as I now remember no more; ſo was not then my weake capacity able to attaine to the knowledge &amp; conceit of thoſe things, which he alleaged. And yet I know not how I vnderſtood this: for when we were ſatisfied, thinking we had kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen it ſufficiently, and that (in our iudgements) there was no more to conceiue, you might haue ſeene him chaunge the whole matter againe, and gaineſay his former propoſitions; ſo that he quite vndid all that he ſaid before, and confuted his former examples by other cleerer aſſertions, and more apparaunt reaſons that he had in ſtore; and when we were inclined to this place, he turned vs againe to the other, and then to the contrarie, at his pleaſure: ſo that he wrought vs like weakelings on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide, as liked him beſt, making vs euer incline to that which he laſt of all alleaged. In the end, though he had ſet all cleerely down before vs; yet (when he liſt) he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and darkened all againe. If he had ſpoken (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) in any other thing but in loue, his company had beene as fit and acceptable to me, as thine is now. But truely it was a ſtrange ſufficiencie in a Shepherd to do what thou haſt told vs: for there is no reaſon (me thinks) to refell that which thou haſt ſaid, by that experience which ſometimes I haue had in like matters. But tell mee yoong Shepherde, where did this Shepherde learne ſo much? I knowe not, ſaide
<hi>Firmius.</hi> For as I am a ſtraunger in theſe partes, ſoe is hee in thoſe. But I imagine that loue, and his good iudgemente were his beſt Schoolemaſters there: For (as I perceiued by him) hee had in both no ſmall experience: and was (as wee heard) <hi>but a Shepherd in habit,</hi> and that his misfortunes had clad him in paſtorall weedes. They muſt (no doubt) be very great (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) when they brought him to ſo poore an eſtate. Doe you not know them well, ſaid <hi>Firmius?</hi> No, ſaid
<hi>Syluanus;</hi> and therefore I pray you tell them vs. It were too long and troubleſome a taske for me (anſwered <hi>Firmius</hi>) to tell them now, and therefore I pray you requeſt it not of me. He ſaieth well (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) and we had alſo need to reſt vs, wherefore let vs goe our waies: And God be with thee gentle Shepherd. And with you, anſwered
<hi>Firmius.</hi> But if our company like thee, ſaide <hi>Syluanus,</hi> come and reſt with vs: the which <hi>Seluagia</hi> and <hi>Syrenus</hi> did alſo both requeſt him to doe. The Shepherd than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them and refuſed, for he had rather beene alone the better to paſſe away his paſſions in ſolitarineſſe, and to goe ſeeke <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe louely face and beauties he caried about with him in his hart. Yet no excuſe could auaile him with the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes, for in the end they caried him with them. The one to take pleaſure in his ſweete companie and conuerſation; the other to weane him (if he could) from his amorous thoughts, with the which he was not meanely troubled for the loue of faire <hi>Diana,</hi> which they well ſuſpected, though he hid it from them, as much as he could, bicauſe he knew not what
<hi>Diana</hi> was, and faine would haue asked, if he had had any good meanes and opportunitie without ſuſpicion. But as they were now come neere to their towne, <hi>Seluagia</hi> ſaid. It ſhall not be amiſſe, to make our towne know of our comming, and content, which our merrie Baggepipes and Rebeckes ſhall ſound foorth. They all agreed thereunto, and tuning one with another, began to play on them very ſweetely. <hi>Syluanus,</hi> and
<hi>Seluagia</hi> vpon Baggepipes, <hi>Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Firmius</hi> vpon Rebeckes. <hi>Seluagia</hi> praied <hi>Firmius</hi> and <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſince the played on Rebeckes to ſing. To play on my Rebecke (ſaide
<hi>Firmius</hi>) though vnwilling I agree thereunto, but to ſing it moſt of all diſcontents me. Yet refuſe not (ſaid <hi>Selua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>) to pleaſure vs. Sing if thou wilt ſomething in the praiſe of faire
<hi>Diana,</hi> for this (I <pb n="180" facs="tcp:23115:95"/>imagine) will not be vnpleaſant vnto thee; and then ſhall <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſing that which beſt likes his fancie. Whereunto <hi>Firmius</hi> condeſcending, and euery one playing on their inſtruments, he began to ſing this Sonnet.</p>

<hi>Syrenus</hi> voice (ſo well knowne amongſt them) and to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the Shepherdes, ſo welbeloued of them all. And bicauſe it was now about that time of the day, when they ſhould defend themſelues from the glowing ſunne, they were a good while in the towne, hauing left their gentle ſheepe vnder the <pb n="181" facs="tcp:23115:95"/>ſhades of diuers trees, and ſafegard of their fierce maſties. Their welcome of the Shepherdes, and their thankes to them againe being paſt, they went all to take their reſt, taking
<hi>Firmius</hi> with them, who maruelled greatly at the earneſt loue and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all the Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes ſhewed at
<hi>Syrenus</hi> comming, of whoſe abſence (which till then he knew not of) he woulde haue talked ſomething with him, but deferred it, vntill he had fitter time and opportunitie. But it was told him before he asked it, and the whole ſucceſſe of his loues from the beginning to his preſent eſtate of life. O how many bitter draughts of iealouſie did he ſwallowe downe in the meane time (thinke you) that they were telling of the fauours, that
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> had in times paſt beſtowed on <hi>Syrenus.</hi> Then would he haue beene glad, that they had neuer begun to tell that wounding diſcourſe, and if at that time they had not made an ende of their talke, they had put him in great perill of his welfare. <hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> perceiued very well his ſecret greefe of minde, by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie changes of his colour, that went and came in his face, that they were apparant ſignes of the preſent greefe he felt. But when they came to the drinke that <hi>Felicia</hi> gaue him, they reſtored him to life againe, who tooke beſides no ſmall ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſeeing how far
<hi>Syrenus</hi> was from <hi>Dianas</hi> fauours, and how freely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alteration of countenance, he talked himſelfe, and heard them tell the thinges that were paſt and gone, whereupon he neuer made an ende in thanking and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſage Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> in his minde, thinking that ſhe had done that eſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour for him, by giuing <hi>Syrenus</hi> the cup of forgetfulnes to drink on, ſince by meanes thereof, ſhe tooke ſo great a blocke out of his way, not bicauſe he thought <hi>Syrenus</hi> knew not how to ſerue and pleaſe her, better then he, nor that he had leſſe good parts in him then <hi>Syrenus,</hi> to obtaine any fauour of her; but bicauſe he being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and <hi>Syrenus</hi> hauing made loue ſo long before him, he thought it a harde matter to bring him out of fauour with
<hi>Diana,</hi> and as difficult a thing to throwe him downe from ſo high an eſtate, as he had attained vnto. But he reuolued in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and conſidered of <hi>Dianas</hi> inconſtancie towards <hi>Syrenus,</hi> though he laide the fault more on <hi>Syrenus</hi> for abſenting himſelfe at ſuch a time, thinking, if he had come then in the nicke, when
<hi>Syrenus</hi> did, that he had knowne better how to haue helpt himſelfe by ſuch an occaſion. His head was ſo occupied in theſe and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, that the Shepherdes perceiuing in what paſſions he was, left him all alone, bicauſe they were glad to pleaſure him in any thing they could, who then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talke of their own affaires, &amp; to giue good order for conuenient prouiſion, &amp; keeping of their flockes. After they had agreed vpon theſe matters, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to know of <hi>Firmius</hi> if he woulde remaine in thoſe parts any long time, and if it were his will to take vpon him the charge and keeping of their flockes till their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: wherupon they went to him, and asked him his name, and knowing it, would haue knowne from whence he came, and what he was. But perceiuing theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands did not like him very wel, they would not vrge him farther then his own will &amp; pleaſure: but they told him what they had agreed vpon, if he thought good to do it. He gaue them many thankes for the good opinion and confidence they had in him, not knowing what he was, ſaying, he was very glad to do it. For though he was minded not to ſtay in that countrey, yet to do them any ſeruice (he could) he woulde at ſuch time make his abode there, during the time they went about their other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines. In the end after they had agreed with him, they deliuered him their flockes, which he kept ſo well and charily all the time that they were yet at home, that they were very glad they had founde out ſo good a keeper, but hee was more, that his <pb n="182" facs="tcp:23115:96"/>fortune was ſo good, to haue ſo fit an occaſion to remaine, where hee thought he might ſomtimes enioy <hi>Dianas</hi> preſence with ſo good an excuſe, and not of intent to procure the ſame.</p>
               <p>In theſe daies (though they were but a fewe) none durſt take in hande to play on their Bagpipes and Rebecks; for ſo ſweete were
<hi>Firmius</hi> his ſongs, and ſo melodious his voice wherewith ſo greatly he rauiſhed the reſt, that they thought their time but ill beſtowed, that was not ſpent in hearing him. They went many times to intreate with <hi>Diana</hi> for him; but ſhe was ſo froward and diſdainefull, that their conuerſation and ſpeeches with her; and her anſwers to them againe pleaſed not each other verie well. Not her, not bicauſe ſhe was not glad to ſee thoſe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds (and <hi>Syrenus</hi> eſpecially) but bicauſe it was a great griefe and torment to her minde to haue him before her eies ſolliciting for another, who was ſometimes all her ioy and delight (hauing yet ſome few reliques of her former loue ſhe bare him) and to ſee him now ſo obliuious of all the ſame. Not the Shepherds, bicauſe being ſo iocond &amp; merry, they woulde not haue any ſad in their companie, eſpecially <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> to whom they wiſhed all the good that might be, though now in another ſort, then in times paſt they did it. And the company both of the one and other neither pleaſed <hi>Diana</hi> nor themſelues, bicauſe that ſorrow and ſolitarines, which pleaſed
<hi>Diana,</hi> the Shepherdes eſchewed and fled, and the delights and ioyfull companie that the Shepherds ſought out, <hi>Diana</hi> did vtterly forſake: So that if they went to ſee her, it was onely to driue out of her minde (if they coulde) her great and greeuous thoughts. Into the which,
<hi>Seluagia</hi> ſeeing her on a day ſo plunged, to ridde her from them, ſaide. So may the Gods be fauourable vnto thee <hi>Diana,</hi> and giue thee that content, which thou moſt deſireſt, if thou wouldſt ſing, and play on thy Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe a little. How art thou deceiued <hi>Seluagia</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Diana</hi>) by thinking that I ſhould hope for content, when I know aſſuredly there is none at all left for me, bicauſe all the waies, whereby it ſhoulde haue paſſage into my ſoule, are now ſtopped vp. And this is my greateſt greefe, that I haue no hope at all neuer to be ridde from my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſorrow. One onely meane, whereon my chiefeſt hope dependeth is left, which is vntimely death. And yet fortune being in euery thing ſo contrary to me, hath taken it away alſo from me, ſince I cannot giue it my ſelfe, without great infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and ſhame to remaine me euer after to my name and memorie: which ſhoulde not yet be a hinderance to the performance of it, nor I would not care for the ſame, if there were not another matter in the way. Thou doſt requeſt me to ſinge, and (alas) I can do nothing but weepe. The day that you came home, I eſſaied to do it, but demand of my hart, if not, of my Baggepipe what paſſed; for this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained afflicted and full of greefe, and that throwen away in a profounde and painfull paſſion, where yet (I thinke) it lies, beſeeching the Soueraigne Gods, that, as I had ſtrength and a hart to caſt my ſenceles Bagpipe away, I had alſo the power to caſt my hart from mee, that then and nowe doth feele ſuch exceſſiue woes. So that now hauing forgotten my ſinging, and left my Bagpipe, pardon me if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I cannot pleaſure thee. Then ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi> to <hi>Seluagia:</hi> It is not in <hi>Dianas</hi> power (faire Shepherdeſſe) to do any thing againſt thy will. Nor in her power (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) to haue any thing fall out to her owne will. But ſince in times paſt (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) when the conquering of thee did moſt of all behooue me, thou didſt euer carrie away the victorie, why then in this (wherin I looſe nothing, nor care to be ouercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) need I pretend to be conquer our? I will not enter into diſputations with thee, and therefore let it be as thou wilt. O how manie inward ſighes did euerie one of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23115:96"/>theſe words, and the remembrance of that which was paſt, coſt afflicted <hi>Diana.</hi> But for loue of thy ſelfe (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi> to <hi>Diana</hi>) let vs goe and ſeeke out thy Bagpipe: for it is no reaſon thou ſhouldeſt requite it ſo ill, that hath done thee ſo good ſeruice: And by the way we will goe to our flockes, and bring thee acquainted with <hi>Firmius,</hi> of whom I haue told thee ſometimes before, and if we could intreate him to ſing, I know thou wouldeſt take great delight to heare him: the one for his great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and wiſedome; the other, bicauſe he is as ſorrowful as thy ſelfe, whereby thou mighteſt (I thinke) receiue ſome comfort and content. But if <hi>Syrenus</hi> had knowen, what ſhould afterwards haue befallen vnto him of theſe praiſes, and of other things which he told of <hi>Firmius,</hi> he would not onely haue left vndone what he did, nor ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at all in the matter, but not once haue had a thought thereof. Thou haſt tolde me ſo much of this new Shepherd (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) that I muſt needes goe ſee him: for there are two things in him (thou telleſt me) befitting my humours ſo well, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his melancholie and ſadde life, wherein I ſhall beſt conforme my ſelfe with him. Now were they come in ſight of the place, where
<hi>Diana</hi> had left her Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, when they ſaw <hi>Firmius</hi> ſinging to the tune of his Rebecke. We are come in good time (ſaid
<hi>Syrenus</hi>) for <hi>Firmius</hi> is ſinging, and (happily) I muſt needes ſay, ſince ſo ſeldome he is wont to do it, being continually ſo full of ſad and penſiue thoughts. Comming therefore ſoftly and ſecretly on, bicauſe they would not be ſeene of him, they heard him ſinging this tranſuerſed <hi>Sextiuen.</hi>

                  <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who of purpoſe (it ſeemed) would haue had
<hi>Diana</hi> ſhew ſome loue to <hi>Firmius,</hi> ſtept before his company, and pulling <hi>Firmius</hi> by the lappe of his coate behinde (for his backe was towards him) ſaid vnto him. I will ſhew thee Shepherde a brauer and freſher bowe then this, and more woorthy of this <hi>Trophee,</hi> and which will perhaps giue thee more content then this Bagpipe, and ſuch a thing that ſhall be no leſſe welcome to it, then to thy ſelfe.
<hi>Firmius</hi> deſired him to ſhew it him. Then <hi>Syrenus</hi> pointing to <hi>Diana</hi> with his finger, ſaid vnto him. Doſt thou ſee it there?
<hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> was ſo altered with the ſudden ſight of faire
<hi>Diana,</hi> that though he would faine haue diſſembled it, neither the colour in his face, nor the faintnes of his legs would giue him leaue to do it, for that was gone, and theſe were not able to ſupport the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die without great paine. But in the end borrowing a little ſtrength of his weaknes, in the beſt ſort he could, he incouraged his hart to hide that, which was ſo openly manifeſt, and anſwered <hi>Syrenus.</hi> There ſhould be other
<hi>Trophees</hi> of higher honour placed in this bowe. By this time came the two Shepherdeſſes, and <hi>Syluanus</hi> and ſaluted him: but he was in ſuch a caſe, ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> ſo neere him, that he gaue no great heed to their ſalutations. Whereupon <hi>Diana</hi> turning to
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſaid. This Shepherd ſhould (belike) talke to none, but to himſelfe alone: for in company (me <pb n="185" facs="tcp:23115:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>thinkes) he hath no liſt to anſwere vs. You muſt needes be the cauſe thereof (ſaide <hi>Seluagia</hi>) for he neuer wanted talke for vs. Now as thou loueſt thy life (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) aske him how he knew my name. This I can tell thee (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) without asking him. For when thou threweſt downe thy Bagpipe in this place, talking with thy ſelfe, thou didſt name thy ſelfe, which I know to be true; for we our ſelues heard it, and then ſhe told her in what ſort they ſaw her, and how they found
<hi>Firmius,</hi> and what he then did and ſaid, when ſhe was gone; and told her moreouer, that they had asked the ſame things of <hi>Firmius</hi> himſelfe, bicauſe in his ſong hee had many times named her. If it be thus (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) he knowes more of my matters then I would he did. But let vs heare what thy <hi>Syluanus</hi> ſayeth vnto vs. We haue requeſted
<hi>Firmius</hi> (ſaide hee) to ſing heere a little, and we can by no meanes entreate him: but as I vnderſtande by others, and partely by mine owne coniecture, that if thou wilt but ſpeake the worde vnto him, hee will doe it by and by. There is no reaſon (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) (by condeſcending to my requeſtes) that hee ſhould denie you yours. But if you be not able to entreate him, heere is <hi>Seluagia,</hi> that can enforce him. Indeed in thy beautie (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) all the force and vertue that is ſufficient to mooue greater matters then this, doth conſiſt. But let vs leaue this, &amp; do that (I pray thee) which my <hi>Syluanus</hi> requeſteth thee. <hi>Diana</hi> then looking vpon <hi>Firmius,</hi> ſaide vnto him. Vrged more by the importunate requeſtes of theſe Shepherdes, then by any confidence of thy part, or aſſurednes of mine owne, I pray thee (yoong Shepherd) ſatisfie their deſires. <hi>Firmius</hi> comming neere to
<hi>Diana,</hi> ſaid vnto her, and ſo ſoftly as they could not heare him. As theſe Shepherdes are in a ſafe hauen, ſo would they not (by their wils) but be euer ſinging and merrie: but as I am continually in ſtormy tempeſtes and ſuffring ſhipwiacke for thy ſake, not knowing on what ſhelfe of diſgrace my fortune will caſt me, would not be but, euer weeping and ſad. But bicauſe I neither can, nor will diſobey thy will, vnleſſe it be in leauing of to ſerue thee (which yet at thine own deſire I can not do) what ſhall pleaſe thee, I will ſing, though it be with a hoarce voice like to the dying ſwanne, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uining her enſuing death. Thou art not ſo neere thy ende (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) that death ſhould helpe thee. I am ſo neere ended (ſaide <hi>Firmius</hi>) that I looke onely but for death. I did neuer yet ſee any (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) die for this cauſe, but with words, and do beleeue beſides, there are not any ſuch: And ſpeaking a little lowder, bicauſe they might all heare, with diſſembling that which ſhe had ſecretly ſpoken vnto him, ſhe ſaide. Thou wouldeſt belike haue me tell thee <hi>(Firmius)</hi> and the reſt, that I am deſirous to heare thee ſing, and bicauſe thou art ſuch a friend to wailing and ſadnes, it were not meete thou ſhouldſt ſing at my will and pleaſure, but to leaue it to thine own. But yet let vs tune &amp; concord with theſe Shepherds, and aske them what thou ſhalt ſing. Thou commeſt too late to agree and concord with vs now, ſaid
<hi>Syrenus:</hi> but bicauſe it pleaſeth thee ſo, entreat him to expreſſe by his ſong the cauſe of his ſorrow and paſſions. Let him ſing what thou wilt (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) and what hee will, bicauſe thou maiſt not ſay, that I neuer knew how to conſorme my ſelfe with thee. Then did <hi>Firmius</hi> take his Rebecke and began to ſing in manner following.</p>

               <p>The Shepherdes gaue a diligent eare to <hi>Firmius</hi> ſong, to ſee if by the ſame hee would giue ſome light of the loue, that he did beare to <hi>Diana;</hi> but he was ſo vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to the contrarie, that though hee reported the cauſe of his paſſion, yet they could vnderſtand no more then they did at the beginning. It was needleſſe for the three Shepherdes to know <hi>Firmius</hi> paſſion by hearing him ſing, who wiſhed rather, that he had manifeſted it by words, that he might not afterwards denie it, or (to ſay better) confeſſe it, when any ſuch ſpeech ſhoulde bee offered thereof. For whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they tolde him of it, he ſpake of it ſo obſcurely, that hee neither confeſſed, nor denied that he loued her. And ſo to this intent he finely cloaked with
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> that <hi>Diana</hi> by his meanes ſhould demand the cauſe of his ſorrow, thinking with himſelf, that (for any thing that might enſue) being demanded by her, he woulde not deny to manifeſt it vnto her. But if he could haue concealed his loue as well by deedes, as he did by wordes, the Shepherds might haue beene as wiſe, as at the firſt for euer
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23115:98"/>knowing it. But it fell not out ſo to <hi>Diana,</hi> who vnderſtood well by his laſt verſe, that all the reſt were onely ment of her, for it anſwered to the latter end of her ſpeech, when they both talked ſo ſecretly togither. And ſo ſhe made great account of
<hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> for his wittie and ſhort anſwer. Euery one commended his ſinging, and <hi>Diana,</hi> as well for this, and for that which he ſung on the Baggepipe, as alſo for that which he had ſpoken to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> was ſomewhat enclined to like him, thinking verie well of that, which he had ſung and ſpoken. Conſidering beſides, that the trouble, which the Shepherd felt, (being in her preſence) was no ſmall cooling carde, and a ſharpe bridle to his toong. For this feare, which <hi>Diana</hi> cleerely perceiued was for her ſake, ſhe ſoone tooke away, bicauſe
<hi>Firmius</hi> might be more accepted of her, if there were (at the leſt) any thing acceptable or pleaſant to one, that found her-ſelfe in ſo miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable an eſtate, as ſhe was. But when the ſong was ended,
<hi>Diana</hi> ſaid ſhe would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, bicauſe ſhe had ſtaied there a great while, and would go ſeeke out her husband <hi>Delius,</hi> who would not willingly haue beene one moment out of her ſight and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Being determined therefore to depart, <hi>Syrenus</hi> entreated her to take her Baggepipe againe with her, if ſo it pleaſed her, bicauſe none other ſhould vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely enioy ſuch a ſweete <hi>Trophee</hi> as
<hi>Firmius</hi> had made of it. She tooke it, bicauſe ſhe thought thereby to ſhewe ſome eſpeciall fauour to <hi>Firmius.</hi> And taking it from the tree, ſhe ſaid vnto it. God knowes, I do not carrie thee as a meane to eaſe or mittigate my paſſion and ſorrow (my intent being cleane contrarie) for though I might ſeeke ſome fauour and helpe to ſuſtaine them (being ſo many as they are) yet will I not aduantage me with any ſuch remedy, but I do take thee with me, bicauſe thoſe Shepherds might not haue an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to blame me for diſcurteſie. When ſhe had ſpoken this, ſhe turned to them, and asked them when they would depart: who told her in the morning, for now they had ſet all things in good order, and durſt not ſtay any longer, bicauſe <hi>Felicia</hi> about that time would looke for their comming, whom they had promiſed to returne aſſoone as they had ſet their flockes in good order, and in the cuſtodie of ſome faithfull Shepherdes. Their departure greeued <hi>Diana</hi> not a little, though ſhe woulde not manifeſt ſo much, but ſaide. Since it is then ſo, the Gods be fauourable vnto you, and be your guides. They thanked her againe, and praied her not to ſorget to looke to their affaires, as they would be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for hers, and charged her beſides, to thinke vpon <hi>Firmius</hi> and his buſines, and to ſupply his wants, if in their abſence, he ſtoode in need of any thing: And that, the pleaſures and fauours that ſhe did him, they would eſteeme as much, as if ſhe had beſtowed them on themſelues, ſince hee remained there to keepe and tende their flockes. Some other thing (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) you might haue demanded at my hands, wherein my good will ſhoulde not be wanting to my power, for this which you requeſt, conſidering his great deſerts, is no leſſe then due to him. Truth it is (ſaid <hi>Firmius</hi>) that of a ſmall deſert it hath reſulted to bee great, not of my part, which coulde not giue ſo great a leape, but of my thought, which hath beene ſufficient enough to make it moſt capable of the great glorie it feeles. And yet for all this thou haſt obliged me to much, for which I will not giue thee thoſe thankes, that are due to ſuch an offer, becauſe thou maieſt not haue occaſion to remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented onely with wordes. I vnderſtande thee not (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) and though I did, yet will I thinke, that I doe not. But knowe Shepherd, that I will doe what I haue ſaide, if I bee well; if not, it may be then an eaſie thing for mee to change my opinion, whereat thou muſt not maruell that I (being the onely diſciple of mutable fortune) doe knowe ſo much what belongs to channge. <hi>Firmius</hi> was ſo <pb n="188" facs="tcp:23115:99"/>aſtoniſhed heereat, that the worde prepared alreadie to anſwer her, ſtucke fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in his mouth with the colde and ſharpe blaſt of her anſwer, and to ſee with what libertie and ſignorie ſhe had openly declared her hard hart.
<hi>Syrenus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that <hi>Firmius</hi> did not ſpeake, ſaide to
<hi>Diana.</hi> Of one being diſcreet, thou art become extreme. Rather (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) of one being extreme (if I may ſay ſo) I am become diſcreet and wiſe: for Fortune hath taught mee ſo much, that ſhe hath brought me to be extreme in beleeuing it: And I am alſo my ſelfe in extremes; and with this I goe, for beholde where <hi>Delius</hi> commeth. For the loue of God come quickely againe. Another time (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) thou didſt requeſt this of me, and did'ſt ſpeake theſe ſelfe ſame words, which then greeued me more, and ſtroke a deeper impreſſion into my ſoule, then now they doe. <hi>Diana</hi> could not hold her teares at theſe words, and turning to <hi>Syrenus</hi> bicauſe ſhe would not be ſeene of them; and going away, ſhe ſaide vnto him. The Gods, <hi>Syrenus,</hi> take account of all theſe cares, that thou pretendeſt to giue me, &amp; of the ſmall benefit thou haſt got in caſting me in the teeth with this ſorrowfull memorie. With this ſhe held her peace, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out a moſt dolefull ſigh, for the griefe of minde had taken her force away from ſpeaking any more; and alſo bicauſe <hi>Delius</hi> was come verie neere vnto her. <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> clogged with the burthen of this grieuous thought, went to gather vp his flockes, bicauſe it was now time. But the Shepherds perceiuing that he was not able alone to driue them togither (being ſo many) euerie one went to helpe him, willing him to take ſome Swaine to his aide, vntill he heard more from them. Whereupon the next morning after, they departed towards <hi>Felicias</hi> Palace.</p>

Thy ſweete ſong and merry Bagpipe (Shepherd) haue both inuited and forced vs (by leauing our high way before due time) to giue ſome reſt to our wearied bodies, and in this place (if our company may not be troubleſom to thee) with thine to paſſe away the burning heate of the day. <hi>Faustus</hi> (for ſo was he called) anſwered.

Although your companie (by that which I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of you) ſhall be as acceptable, as your ſelues welcome to me.

<hi>Syluanus</hi> ſaide vnto him.

               <p>Thou haſt ſufficiently prooued it (ſaide
<hi>Syluanus</hi>) and truely I cannot but woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the new manner of loues proceeding, and how in the ende (like one, whom this affaire toucheth) thou haſt highly pondred and weighed it in thy minde. But ſo may God giue thee a good hand in thy loue of the hand, as thou wouldeſt tell vs the manner he had to bring thee to the ſweete bondage of ſo faire a hande. From that (ſaid
<hi>Faustus</hi>) which hitherto you haue heard, you may deduce (as it were) al the reſt; but paſſing that ſleightly ouer, which I haue already tolde you, I will briefely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the reſt. Liuing (as I now haue told you) not meanely contented in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee my ſelfe free (if he may be termed free, that is farre from loue) on a night I went to viſite a friend of mine, a certaine Shepherd, who was by chance wounded with a knife, with whom paſſing away the time, in lamenting his miſhap (diuining perhaps mine owne) a Shepherdeſſe, diſguiſed in her attyre, and hauing all her face couered ouer with a fine white vaile, came ſweetely in, ſo comely and gracefull a perſonage, as by her diſcreete words I iudged her to be of excellent and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite. Of both which things, as immediately, ſo not meanely was I enamoured, for of any other part I could not, bicauſe her iniurious vaile did hide the reſt. But after a little while (to my great harme) ſhe pulled out a hand (a hand I ſay ſhe pulled out) for I know not how ſuch a perfect brightnes could be couered. At the ſight where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mine eies were ſo blinded, to giue light to my vnderſtanding, that though ſhe did afterwards diſcouer her faire face, yet I was not able to behold it. She went from thence ſooner then I would, and I (ſooner then my neede required) exiled my ſelfe from my wonted ioy: for ſhe woulde not giue me ſo much as leaue to accompanie her with this miſerable bodie, whoſe happie ſoule went away in her heauenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; whereby you may iudge what kinde of man I then was, that remained in ſuch anxieties, and what I am alſo now, who neuer ſince could finde out the meanes to ſee her any more. And (Shepherd) this is the ſumme of that thou didſt deſire to knowe of mee. If thou telleſt vs nothing elſe (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) it then ſeemes that as this Shepherdeſſe doth neither know thee, ſo thy paſſion is not manifeſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her. It is true, ſaid <hi>Faustus,</hi> ſhe knowes me not, but hath had ſome certaine notice of me by the meanes of another faire Shepherdeſſe, with whom ſhe keepes daily company: who to do me a pleaſure (for ſurely ſhe euer wiſhed my content) made me write vnto her, vpon aſſured promiſe to giue my letter into her own hands, &amp; to procure me an anſwer againe: though from the laſt ſhe hath not yet diſcharged hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. True it is, ſhe tels me (or faines at the leaſt to put me in ſome hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort) that ſhe hath promiſed me an anſwer. I pray thee pleaſure vs ſo much (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) to ſhew vs thy letter, for being written by thine owne hands, there can be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:23115:101"/>nothing elſe expected, but an ingenious and well compoſed order in it. Although there is no ſuch matter (ſaide
<hi>Fauſtus</hi>) yet for your pleaſure I will ſhewe it you, for heere I haue the copie of it, hoping by theſe meanes to diſcharge me of you; but it is in proſe of purpoſe, bicauſe I vnderſtood how certaine of my rude rymes (againſt my will) came to her hands. I thinke not (ſaide
<hi>Syluanus</hi>) that thy well penned proſe is of leſſe ſubſtance and commendation then thy pleaſant and gracious verſe, and yet I haue heard, that it requires many things more, not ſo commonly knowne to vs Shepherds.

                     </head>
                     <p>HE that hath none himſelfe, nor wiſheth to haue any, but onely that which may come from thy hands, ſends thee (Gracious Shepherdeſſe) all the health in the world. My rude hand trembleth to thinke, that a letter written by it, muſt come to thy faireſt hands, in whoſe iudgement it lies not otherwiſe (I ſuſpect) but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne my bold attempt, and chaſtiſe my fooliſh raſhnes, and that I ſhall not haue force to ſuffer the rigour of thy angrie hand, if thou doſt but once withdraw it from my comfort and ſuccour. For thou muſt not vnderſtand that (to make thee amends for the iniurie I haue done thee) as being but a baſe Shepherd, to haue placed my thoughts on ſo famous a yoong Shepherdeſſe, there needes any more puniſhment, then the wound, which thy faire and cruel hand hath giuen me, if by the ſame againe I am not fauoured with ſome remedie. I know well faire Shepherdeſſe (pardon me for ſaying ſo) that reading theſe ill compacted lines, thou wilt be in ſuſpence to know the man, that ſhewes himſelfe ſo much appaſſionate for thy ſake; if any ſuch thing occur to thy thoughts, demaund it I beſeech thee, of a hart, which thou haſt lately got into thy ſubiection, for that ſhal tell thee ſo ſincere and pure a truth, as here by a ſenceleſſe wit ſimply ſet down. Alas for me, that going to viſite one wounded with a knife, I returned from thence wounded by thy Iuorie hand; &amp; thou going to comfort a weake man in bodie, did'ſt leaue me wounded in ſoule. Behold therefore, if being compaſſionate with him, thou haſt not beene cruell to me. Thou wilt ſay perhaps, thou didſt not thinke, any ſuch thing would fall out, which I beleeue verie well, when as the ſame did as little fall in the compaſſe of my thought. But yet thou canſt not be iuſtly excuſed from fault and puniſhment, ſince, no leſſe then her, that with ſuſpitious and priuie weapons armes her ſelfe, thou art woorthie of both. Who then can carrie about her ſuch ſecret weapons as thou haſt done, aſſayling my ſoule (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed then and without defence) with ſuch a victorious and wounding hand. I will not trouble thee any more with my vnpoliſhed &amp; ſimple reaſons, vntil the ſtring of my iarring fanſies be tuned by thy moſt ſoueraigne hande, which the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods defend with their mightie handes, as thou maiſt me with thy milke white hand.</p>

               <p>This letter being ſhort and ſententious pleaſed the Shepherdes verie much. But when it was read out, <hi>Faustus</hi> ſaid. Behold here (good Shephedes) the eſtate wherein I am attending the ſentence of my glorious death, or happie life, written by that incomparable white hand. Entreat (gentle Shepherdes) the Amorous God of loue (if your ſacrifices be acceptable to him) to wound her, like my ſelfe, with his golden headed arrow, and hide his leaden one from her. If the ſeruants of this little boy (enamoured Shepherd) ſaid <hi>Seluagia,</hi> may preuaile any thing to obtaine ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour <pb n="193" facs="tcp:23115:101"/>of him, thou ſhalt be ſoone deliuered from theſe paſſions, by the milde entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my Shepherd
<hi>Syluanus</hi> here, and of my ſelfe. But it is needleſſe to make this Shepherd <hi>Syrenus,</hi> a meane and interceſſour for thee, bicauſe he is the moſt iniurious rebell to loue that dwels in theſe villages here abouts. O <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſaid <hi>Faustus!</hi> Is it poſſible that I inioy the thing before mine eies that (next to my moſt ſoueraigne Shepherdeſſe) I deſired to ſee, whoſe loues haue wearied fame ſo much in euerie place? I was about to aske you who you were, and which way you trauelled, wherein it onely remaines for you to ſatisfie my deſire, ſince of the firſt I am not ignorant. Although firſt I would rather aduiſe thee
<hi>Syrenus</hi> (for keeping my promiſe to <hi>Cupid</hi>) and pray thee beſides (hauing mature conſideration to his inuincible might) to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and obey him, and to beware to rebell againſt his ſoueraigntie, bicauſe thou maiſt not ſay, that I haue not warned thee before. I thanke thee for thy good will ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> but for thy cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel I care not. Well (ſaid <hi>Faustus</hi>) herein I haue diſcharged my duty, &amp; thou maiſt do what thou thinkeſt beſt. But yet take heed leaſt ſomtimes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after thou beeſt not puniſhed like my ſelfe. But then
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> bicauſe he would not haue him talke any more of that matter, told him whither they went, but could not tell him of their returne. I am ſorrie for that (ſaid <hi>Faustus</hi>) bicauſe at your returne I would willingly goe with you to ſee the vngratefull Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Dians,</hi> whom I haue heard woonderfully commended for beautie and fine graces, and to behold in what hart ſuch forgetfulnes could harbour, hoping (that if, for the great deſire I haue to ſee her, I ſtay here till your returne to accompanie you home) thou w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> not be angrie <hi>Syrenus.</hi> Not I, ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> but as I muſt warne you to take heed; ſo muſt I tell you, that this counſell is better for you, then that which you gaue me. In theſe and other ſpeeches they paſſed the time away, vntill the hower of their departure came, wherein with profered courteſies, and gentle offers on both ſides they went euerie one his way.</p>
               <p>With ſome ſmall force yet went vermillion <hi>Apollo</hi> ſhining ouer the face of our old mother, when the three Shepherds, comming neere to the Iland where they had beene before at their laſt departure, did ſee a companie of people together, and as they came neerer to them, knew it was <hi>Felicia,</hi> &amp; ſome of her Nymphes, with <hi>Don Felix,</hi> and his Lady <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> Not a little amazed thereat, they ſtaied, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued how they came guiding their ſteps towardes them. But they maruelled verie much to ſee them come ſo ſilent, and not talking a worde. But <hi>Felicia</hi> being come, and the Shepherds, hauing in dutifull ſort ſaluted her and the reſt, asked her the cauſe of their comming that way, and of their vnwoonted ſilence. Whom ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſaying. The deſire I haue (my friendly Shepherds) to pleaſure Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and the loue I beare to you, to giue you all poſſible content, hath mooued me to bring them hither againſt your comming, bicauſe you might in ſo delightfull a place as this, recreate your mindes altogither. The cauſe of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in ſuch ſilent ſort, and without any ſinging of theſe louers, or of my Nymphes is, bicauſe their noiſe may not depriue both them, and you of a ſight woorthie the marking, which ſhal by &amp; by enſue: wherby you ſhall know, that as you your ſelues are not onely in loue, ſo all alone you do not ſuffer troubles and ſorrowes for your deereſt loues: And therfore I will you all to follow me as ſoftly as you can. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy then going vp with her companie along the Spring in the Iland (the way which I ſaid before did lead to the pleaſant meade where the fountaine of the Laurell trees was) came vnawares to the very entrance of it: The which Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Ladie (not hauing ſeene that place before) imagined it to be ſome earthly para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23115:102"/>or that they were in the pleaſant fieldes of
<hi>Elyſium,</hi> although they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to take any other delight therein, but only the pleaſant view therof with their wandring eies, bicauſe (for the ſtrict ſilence inioyned them) with wordes and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy praiſes, they durſt not extol that place of paradiſe, nor had leaue to demand any thing concerning the ſame. At the entrance of it, <hi>Felicia</hi> ſat her downe, and all the reſt after her, who ſtaied there a pretie while, not daring almoſt to breath, and ſawe no more, then the trembling Sunne-beames, that with force ſeemed to paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene leafe and leafe amongſt the greene trees that grewe neere togither; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon their thoughts went wandring, and muſing of many matters, and their harts were conſtrained to bite on the bit of forced patience: And faine they would haue changed (in their iudgements) the pleaſure to ſee that which <hi>Felicia</hi> promiſed them, to be ridde of the diſcontent, which their ſilence did procure them. Which thing (when ſhe perceiued it) made her ſmile a little to herſelfe. Being thus therfore in this pleaſant meadow, and tedious mutenes, <hi>Felicia</hi> pointed with her finger to an entrance thereof right ouer againſt them, to haue them all looke that way, where caſting their eies, they ſawe a reuerend old man comming in, graue in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, perſon, and diſpoſition, as alſo in the manner of his habite and apparell: for in euery point he ſeemed to repreſent a moſt woorthie prieſt of <hi>Iupiter.</hi> Hee came holding a ſtaffe in his right hand, and ſuſtained vpon it his olde and wearied body, whereon ſometimes leaning, he looked ſtedfaſtly on the grounde, like a man full of imaginations, and ſometimes againe lifted vp his eies to heauen, like one moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and comfortleſſe. He made ſuch ſundrie kindes of motions and geſtures of his body, (obſeruing yet alwaies the due grauitie of his noble perſon) that he did not onely mollifie the tender harts of them that were looking on him, but had been able to haue made the cruell
<hi>Hircanian</hi> Tygres milde and gentle, if they had beene preſent, eſpecially with the outward ſhewes of ſorrow that he repreſented of ſome inwarde greefe: for in the middes thereof he gaue a turne about, viewing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens on euery ſide, and ſpeaking againſt Fortune (of whom he ſeemed to make his chiefeſt complaint) he vttered this that followeth.</p>

               <p>He had no ſooner made an end of the complaints, which he declamed againſt Fortune, when walking towards the fountaine (from the which he was not twentie paces) on the ſudden they ſaw him fling away his ſtaffe, and with a luſtie kinde of agilitie (contrary to his aged limmes) laie hand on his Faulchion, which from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſide garment that he wore, he tooke out to ſmite a certaine Shepherd that laie a ſleepe in that ſide of the meadow. When they that were thus beholding him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with what furie he ranne vpon the ſilly Shepherd (whom hitherto they had not ſeene) and with his naked Faulchion in his hande, they would all haue runne to helpe him, but that ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> with ſignes which ſhe made vnto them, willed them to ſit ſtill, telling them the matter ſhould not need it. But the old man was now lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp his Faulchion to ſmite him on the head, when two beggerly and foule rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Shepherdeſſes which were at hand, riſing from the ground, tooke hold on him, the one with a ſorrowfull voice ſaying vnto him. O my good Father. But the old man vnwinding himſelf from them ſtept back, making as though he would ſmite hir that went about to hinder him. Wherupon ſhe, that had firſt ſpoken, perceiuing that he knew her not, ſpake to him againe, ſaying. O my deer Father <hi>Pariſiles</hi> (for this was his name.) The angry &amp; afflicted old man amazed at the tender voice he now knew, and like the marble ſtone benummed in all his ſences, let his Faulchion preſently fall out of his hands, whom then the Shepherdeſſe (calling him by the ſame name as before) moſt louingly embraced, as he was falling downe to the ground. Who comming to himſelfe againe, and with the teares of milde loue ſupplying the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted voice of his breſt, threwe his aged armes vpon her, and that face of hers which with lothſome mudde and durt was ſo much defiled, ſweetely beganne to kiſſe. <hi>Felicia</hi> turning to her companie, that (being nowe ridde from the greefe of their late paſſed ſilence) was laughing with a ſcornfull delight at the preſent ſight, to ſee him kiſſe that foule ill fauoured face, ſaid. Maruell not my ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to ſee you reuerend old man kiſſe thoſe deformed cheekes, for fatherly loue extendeth to more then that, ſo that if ſhe ſeemes foule in your eies, he thinkes her faire, and no leſſe doth the Shepherd that lieth there aſleepe. Like will to like, ſaide <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> It is ſo (ſaide

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:23115:103"/>to the honorable old man, as to be embraced with ſuch an vnſeemelines, let vs go to put them aſunder. Whereupon they went towards them, and making as though they had not ſeene them before, <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaid vnto them. God ſaue this noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. The other Shepherdeſſe yeelded her due thankes, and a courteous anſwer, for the Shepherd was yet ſleeping, and the old man and the other Shepherdeſſe were ſtill embracing each other. Lord <hi>Felix</hi> comming to them both, ſaid. Thou ſhouldeſt haue enough noble Lord of theſe vnfit embracements. Whereat
<hi>Felicia</hi> laughed to her-ſelfe, to ſee how much in their mindes they diſdained the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. But the old man ſaid. Nowe may yee (O Gods) conclude my many daies with their laſt period, ſince you haue granted me this vnſpeakeable fauour, to ſee my deereſt daughter: now may yee make an end of my wearied yeeres, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eies my onely beloued
<hi>Stela,</hi> (for ſo was the Shepherdeſſe called that ſpake vnto him) <hi>Stela</hi> mine onely hope, my ioy and comfort of my life. To this end my praiers tended, to lengthen my decaying life, and to ſee this ioyfull day. This was the white whereat my petitions, oblations, and ſacrifices aymed, for proroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my death. And now let it come when it wil, ſince I haue her in my preſence, who in deſpite of death maintaines my life; but yet gentle death, rather then by any other misfortune that may enſue, I might be depriued of her againe, come and bereaue me of this common light. O my deereſt daughter, who did take thee away from me, for I coulde neuer beleeue that of thine owne accord thou wouldſt haue left me without firſt taking leaue of thy louing father. Woe befall to thee (falſe Shepherde) that lieſt there aſleepe, and an ill end betide thy friend, whereſoeuer he be, if he hath it not yet already. Bende not thy eares, O <hi>Iupiter</hi> (ſaide the Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe) to this cruell petition, but rather turne it vpon me (a thing more requiſite for my miſeries) and not on them, whoſe goodnes neuer deſerued any ill at all. I will not conſent (good Father) nor be content to heare them accurſed, that in all points are ſo faultleſſe.
<hi>Lo</hi> (<hi>Loue</hi> ſhe would haue ſaid hath erred, if modeſtie and maidenly ſhame had not ſtaied her toong in the middeſt) I haue erred, or rather my Fortune (to ſpeake more truely) hath beene to blame, by granting me no meanes to take my leaue of thee. <hi>Felicia,</hi> who knewe the cauſe of the Shepherdeſſe her greefe, ſaid. Let theſe excuſes now ceaſe. And <hi>Pariſiles</hi> forſake thy ſadnes, ſince now thou inioyeſt thine onely deſire. Who turning to ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> and marking with what graue auctoritie ſhe ſpake vnto him, ſaid vnto her. Whoſoeuer thou art (noble La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die) whether thou doſt recken thy ſelfe in the number of mortall women, or art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the Catalogue of the immortall Gods (for ſuch an one thou ſeemeſt to be) pardon me, if hitherto I haue not done my obliged duetie, and reuerence, hauing ſo pitifull and condigne a cauſe of pardon: in euerie thing hereafter I am wholy at thy deuotions, and ſubiect to thy commaund whatſoeuer. It is well, ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> we ſhall thinke of that hereafter. And bicauſe I will make thee more ioyfull, then euer thou thoughteſt to be (for from him thy comfort ſhall proceed, of whom thou doſt moſt complaine) let vs goe to reſt vs vnder the ſhadowes of thoſe Laurell trees, neere to the ſiluer fountaine brincke: and that thou maiſt beleeue my words to be true, know that I am <hi>Felicia,</hi> if euer my name hath ſounded in thine eares. <hi>Pariſiles</hi> then with the Shepherdeſſes fell downe on their knees to kiſſe her hands, ſaying. Who of all thoſe, that honour our immortall Gods, is there, that is ignorant of the portion which thou haſt with them? <hi>Felicia</hi> lifted them all three vp, and would not ſuffer them to do her ſuch honour, and taking one of the Shepherdeſſes by the hand (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Crimine</hi>) ſaid to all the reſt. Go you (my Sonnes) to the fountaine, and reſt you
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23115:104"/>there, while I talke with this Shepherdeſſe, and with that Shepherd a word or two. And thou (my friend <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) with thy deere daughter ſhalt keepe them company, and tell them ſome famous hiſtorie, or antiquite, vntill it be time to go in to dinner. Then taking
<hi>Crimine</hi> by the hand, ſhe went towards the Shepherd that was yet ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping all this while, and ſhaking him by the ſhoulder, awaked him, &amp; ſaid. He ſhould ſleep but a little, that comes as a guard to two faire yoong Shepherdeſſes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the vnknowen Shepherd awaked, and not ſeeing <hi>Stela,</hi> without making the ſage Ladie any anſwere, with a ſudden ſurſault of griefe, ſaid. O <hi>Crimine,</hi> where is
<hi>Stela?</hi> Be not afraid (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) for ſhe is not far from hence. Thou mighteſt do better to looke more aduiſedly to thy ſelfe, when as but euen now thy temporall ſlumber had verie neere caſt thee into thy laſt and endleſſe ſleepe. They (of whoſe liues and honours they choſe thee their onely ampare) had more care to faue thy late en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered perſon, then thou hadſt of thy ſelfe or them. And bicauſe thou maiſt ſee vnto what extremitie thy fates had almoſt brought thee, knowe that it is not long ſince the knife was at thy throate readie to cut it. The Shepherd could not imagine what ſhe meant by theſe words, nor what companie that was, that ſat about the fountaine, where (turning his eies about to ſee
<hi>Stela</hi>) he eſpied her, but <hi>Crimine</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly admoniſhed him to doe his duetie to <hi>Felicia,</hi> who then making low obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance vnto her, craued pardon of her. <hi>Felicia</hi> then told him in order what had paſſed; and how <hi>Pariſiles</hi> forgetting his aged weaknes, and ayded by the force of his furie, would haue killed him, &amp; how they would not let him, with that that folowed. In the end the Shepherd was verie ſad, when he knew that old <hi>Pariſiles</hi> was there, not for feare of him, but bicauſe he now thought to looſe his beloued <hi>Stela,</hi> which ſage
<hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> perceiuing, ſaid vnto him. Abandon (Shepherd) theſe ſorrowfull thoughts, for all ſhall redound to thy content and ioy: for now thou art in ſuch a place, where thou ſhalt haue no wrong, and where thy paſſed troubles, &amp; thoſe of thy ſweet company &amp; deereſt friends ſhall be better ended, then thou art able to imagine. To all this the Shepherd could yeeld no more but humble thankes, though it was not ſufficient to comfort him, bicauſe he was abſent from a deere friend of his, whom he loued more then himſelfe, and who euer requited him with no leſſe loue againe, as by manie proofes moſt often it appeered. For well might they two haue been the thirde number, annexed to the onely two paire of friends, that after ſo manie thouſande yeeres were accounted in the world for the greateſt. But the Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> aſſured him, how ſhe would finde out ſome meanes to haue him thither out of hande. At which words he fell downe on his knees, and kiſſed her hands, for any thing that ſhe could do the contrarie. In theſe and other ſpeeches, they went talking vp and downe a pretie while. But God knowes, how <hi>Crimine</hi> was aſhamed of her-ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Felicia,</hi> though it was not long, for
<hi>Felilia</hi> did remedie that by and by, hauing taken her aſide to no other ende from the reſt of the companie. While theſe three were in theſe ſpeeches, Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena,</hi> the three Nymphes, and the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, deſirous to knowe who theſe fower were, and for what cauſe
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> in ſo great an anger would haue killed the Shepherd that lay aſleepe, and all the reſt of his fortunes, would faine haue demanded the ſame on him. But yet they did not, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuſpected he would not tell it them. Whereupon they reſerued it, till <hi>Felicia</hi> was come, to entreat her to mooue <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> or the reſt thereof, bicauſe they knewe they could not then excuſe themſelues. Lord <hi>Felix</hi> therefore with the reſt praied <hi>Pariſiles</hi> to obey the ſage
<hi>Felicia,</hi> by diſcourſing ſome noueltie vnto them. But they ſeemed importunate &amp; troubleſome vnto him, for he would not (willingly)
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:23115:104"/>haue beene one moment from the louing embracements of his beloued daughter <hi>Stela,</hi> &amp; ſo did not one minute (when from any other forced thing he ceaſed) caſt his tender eies off her, whereby he gaue
<hi>Stela</hi> no meanes to looke vpon the vnknowne Shepherd, on whom her eies and hart attended: but euery time that ſhe might ſteale a looke from her Father <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> making as though ſhe ſat not well, or as though ſhe would ſpit or cough, then with earneſt deſire and affection ſhe beheld him. But in the end the old man hauing no good excuſe to acquite himſelfe from <hi>Felicias</hi> commaund, nor from the requeſts of that faire companie, which ſo ſeriouſly demaunded it of him, began to ſay in this ſort.</p>
               <p>My louing Sonnes (for by the priuiledge of mine age I may call you ſo) for as much as the greater part of my life hath beene dedicated to the worſhip and ſeruice of our moſt ſoueraigne Gods, and eſpecially of our Goddeſſe <hi>Iſis</hi> (whoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Prieſt from the entrance of my youth I haue beene) it would be moſt agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my condition, to entreat of the maner, that ought to be obſerued in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of her, and how much we are bound to performe the ſame. But bicauſe you haue for your Ladie and miſtreſſe (for ſo I take her to be, bicauſe you do accompanie and follow her) the ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> to whom not I my ſelfe (the loweſt of all Prieſts) but the beſt in all the world may iuſtly be diſciples, it muſt needes be a part beyonde all courteſie, and good manners to enterpriſe any ſuch taske. And this difficultie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides doth offer it ſelfe to my minde, in that I know not, with what hiſtorie to delight al your eares: For the difference of eſtates, which in this noble companie I perceiue, ſtrikes a doubt into my minde vpon the choiſe of my diſcourſe, conſidering with my ſelfe, that that which will pleaſe ſome, will (perhaps) offend others. To theſe Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdes I could preſent ſome things requiſite for their poore eſtate and vocations, and profitable for them and their flockes, and ſome curious ſecretes, which they ſhoulde knowe (happily) neuer yet thought on amongſt Shepherdes. As likewiſe from whence the playing on the fluite or Bagpipe firſt came, and when the honour of their God <hi>Pan,</hi> and the cuſtomes and rites, which in old times they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in their ſacrifices, were firſt in vſe, and why thoſe are decaied, and other now admitted in their places. To you noble perſonages, I could preſent (a thing (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) which would beſt fit your deſires) whereof loue was firſt engendred, and how he worketh, and for what cauſe the God of Loue doth keepe no reaſon, being honored as a God, we holding it for a rule infallible, That the Gods are iuſt, and that in all things they obſerue due iuſtice and equitie. And this is that, which I would more willingly entreate of, bicauſe in theſe meadowes heere, a queſtion was once mooued, which touched not the ſimplicitie of the Shepherd that did aske it. But bicauſe to declare it well, it were neceſſary to entreate of the powers of the ſoule, and the duties thereof, and what place euery one of them hath in mans body, (a diſputation more fit for Philoſophers ſchooles, then for the fieldes, where none but flockes are) I will not explaine it, reſeruing it onely for any one that will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be priuately inſtructed. But bicauſe I haue heere a thing before mine eies, which filleth me with admiration, (although it may be, that many that haue beene heere haue perhaps touched the ſame) I will make my beginning thus. Do you not ſee how nature and arte, the one borrowing that of the other, wherein either of them was defectiue, haue done their vtmoſt in making this Iland or meadow (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it as it ſhall beſt pleaſe you) the very paterne of the Elyſian fieldes? But lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing aſide many things, that I could note vnto you about this matter, I will declare vnto you why this Oke is placed heere in the middes of theſe Laurell trees, bicauſe <pb n="200" facs="tcp:23115:105"/>you may vnderſtand that there was nothing done nor placed heere, but with great wiſedome and conceite. The loues of
<hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Daphne,</hi> are ſufficiently knowen vnto you, I meane of <hi>Apollo</hi> with <hi>Daphne,</hi> as alſo the preheminences wherewith this God endowed the Laurell tree, whereinto this Nymph was transformed. But how? <hi>Doria</hi> at theſe words interrupting his diſcourſe, ſaide. Me thinkes (noble <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) thou haſt plaied the part of a gentleman Sewer, that haſt (at our chiefeſt appetite) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away our beſt diſhes. Since then theſe noble perſonages (pointing to Lord <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) whom the ſubiect of loue did more narrowly touch, and theſe Shepherds (pointing to
<hi>Syrenus, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi>) to whom the firſt point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, haue let thee paſſe on without interruption, my ſelfe (to whom it chiefely appertaines, to heare the accidents of ſo famous a Nymph, bicauſe I am one my ſelfe) will not (with my will) giue thee leaue to proceed any farther, before thou haſt told vs the beginning of
<hi>Apollos</hi> loues, &amp; why <hi>Daphne</hi> refuſed and diſdained ſo high a God. <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> bluſhing for ſhame and anger, that <hi>Doria</hi> had poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and not to them, when ſhe ſaide, that the queſtions of loue belonged more to Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> taking
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> by the hande, ſaide. And how thinkeſt thou Nymph? Are we in reſpect of theſe two ſo farre from loue, that to them onely, and not to vs the treatiſe of this demand is more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining? Euery one laughing at the Shepherds words, <hi>Doria</hi> anſwered. I haue made a fault (Shepherds) and ſo I confeſſe it. It pleaſeth me well (faire Nymph ſaid <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) to obey thee heerein. But if I begin at the very beginning, it may be I ſhall not make an end before the ſage Lady commeth, where (being conſtrained to end abruptly) I ſhall perhaps do you more wrong, then if I had not begun at all. Leaue not of for this (ſaide
<hi>Feliſmena</hi>) for if it be ſo, we will requeſt her to giue vs leaue to heare out the reſt. Since then you will haue it ſo (ſaide
<hi>Pariſiles</hi>) giue attentiue eare, for I will recite it vnto you as I did ſee it written in <hi>Apollo</hi> his Temple.</p>

                        <l>And ſaid, if that ſhe had ſuch cauſe to vaunt</l>

               <p>The good old man <hi>Pariſiles</hi> went proſecuting his hiſtorie, carrying all his hearers with him verie ſilent, by reaſon that the ſubſtance thereof (as alſo the ſtile wherewith he told it) delighted them verie much, when they perceiued the ſage <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> comming with <hi>Crimine,</hi> and the vnknowen Shepherd towardes them, whoſe comming made not <hi>Stela</hi> a little glad, for ſhe lent but a ſmall eare to the tale, bicauſe the Shepherd was not in her companie. But
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> turning his head, and ſeeing <hi>Felicia,</hi> ſaid. Behold how it fals out true, which I feared: my tale ſhall breake off till another day, when we will haue fitter time and place for it, wherein nothing ſhall be loſt hauing made ſo good a beginning. By no meanes (ſaide
<hi>Doria</hi>) will I conſent hereunto. The like did all affirme with one voice. Then came <hi>Felicia,</hi> and as they were riſing to do her honour, they ſaw the Shepherd that came with her, to be the faireſt, moſt gracious, and goodlieſt youth of perſon, as euer they beheld before. His weedes were of gray cloth, to ſignifie by that colour his troubles and griefes. All along the border of his coate, and ſleeues, went three ribons or laces of ſundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, two of them on either ſide, of Lion tawney and Oliue greene, to ſignifie by the firſt his ſorrow, and by the ſecond his torment. That in the mids of his ſorrow and torment was his hope. Other things did the Shepherd weare, worthie himſelfe, and to be marked. But
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> did hinder them, bicauſe <hi>Crimine</hi> returned now cleane, and waſhed at <hi>Felicias</hi> requeſt, whom now he alſo knew, and therefore with a loud voice, with caſting vp his eies to heauen, he ſaid. And is it true (O <hi>Iupiter</hi>) which with mine eies I here behold? O ſweete Nymph; my friend and miſtreſſe. Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thou art here? If I had knowen my deere daughter had gone in thy company, I would haue ſomewhat moderated my griefe for her abſence. And being come to her, with reuerence he louingly embraced her. But both of them deſiring earneſtly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:23115:109"/>to know the meanes of their vnlooked for comming to that place, <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaid. Defer this till further time: for I know theſe queſtions will not hereafter a little delight this companie. Come thou <hi>Crimine,</hi> and ſpeake to all this companie, who will be verie glad of thine. They were a prettie while in congratulations and conueſies, wondering at <hi>Crimines</hi> beautie, and therefore at laſt thus ſaid. Why did ſuch a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning gemme as this (Ladie <hi>Felicia</hi>) goe hidden in ſuch a baſe couerture: if her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion be ſuch another, do vs this fauour to make her waſh her ſelfe? To auoide all danger by reaſon of their tempting beautie (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) and not to be moleſted like thoſe, that haue ſuffered many inconueniences for theirs, they haue gone thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in apparell and face. As for the waſhing of this yoong Shepherdeſſe (pointing to <hi>Stela</hi>) it ſhall remaine at my pleaſure, when I will requeſt her to doe it, for dinner being nowe readie, I will deferre it till ſome other time, for feare I ſhould giue you a dinner againſt your ſtomacke, for waſhing nowe her fowle face and handes, will not (perhaps) make you eat ſo much, as otherwiſe you would, and make you haue a leſſe appetite, then to ſee them in the manner that nowe they be. But if you like not of her companie at dinner, ſhe ſhall ſit by her ſelfe, and dine with <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> in whoſe eies ſhe is nothing ſo ſoule, nor ill-fauoured. And then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to her Nymphes, ſhe commanded them to bring in dinner, who preſently came in with it. But if you pleaſe good Lady (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) command <hi>Pariſiles</hi> firſt to make an end of the tale he hath begun. Since you will haue it ſo (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) I will entreat, not command him. It were great reaſon ſage Lady (ſaide <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) to hold my peace, &amp; not to ſhewe ſo great rudenes before your ſingular wiſedome, if it were not more to obey your iuſt command. It is well (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) leaue off this, and do that which all the companie heere requeſteth thee.
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> then began thus. Obeying then moſt willingly (great Lady) what you haue giuen me in charge, and purpoſing to tell the cauſe why this Oke was planted betweene theſe two Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel trees, I haue touched the gifts, that <hi>Apollo</hi> gaue to the Laurell tree, when <hi>Daphne</hi> was turned into it: From whence this noble company did not ſuffer me to paſſe any further, though I alleaged ſome excuſes to the contrary, but that I muſt needes from the beginning recount this transformation of <hi>Daphne</hi> into a Laurell tree. And ſo hauing told of the glorious victorie, that
<hi>Apollo</hi> had of the ſerpent <hi>Python,</hi> and of the quarrell and contention betweene him and <hi>Cupid</hi> for carying both one wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, I went on along telling, how <hi>Apollo</hi> being proud of this conqueſt, by chance caſt his eies vpon the faire and chaſte Nymph <hi>Daphne:</hi> And when you came hither good Lady with <hi>Crimine,</hi> you gaue a gracious impediment to my tale. So that now (ſince it is your pleaſure) I will proccede in it, beginning onely but with a worde or two recited before, to annexe that, and this that followeth the better togither.</p>

               <p>And now beholde (noble companie) how I haue fulfilled your commands, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not ſo fitly to your demand nor my deſire. Woorthie
<hi>Pariſiles</hi> (ſaide Lorde <hi>Felix</hi>) you haue done no leſſe then was expected at your hands: but yet one doubt remaineth in my minde, for what reaſon the Oke is better kept then any other tree, ſince there are of others a great number more neceſſarie for mans life. There is no God (anſwered <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) but hath ſome tree, birde, beaſt, or other thing dedicated to his deitie: as the Oliue to <hi>Minerua;</hi> the Laurell to <hi>Apollo;</hi> the Turtle doue to <hi>Venus;</hi> the Peacocke to
<hi>Iuno,</hi> and ſo foorth. But bicauſe <hi>Iupiter</hi> is the higheſt of the Gods, and the Oke is dedicated to him, for this reſpect, to that tree, more then to any other, we do greater reuerence. I am ſatisfied, ſaide Lord
<hi>Felix.</hi> But tell me (I pray you) why the Oke was rather dedicated to him then any other tree. To ſhewe the infinite power and might of
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> ſaide <hi>Pariſiles.</hi> It is well anſwered (ſaide
<hi>Felicia.</hi>) And for this time let demands &amp; anſwers ceaſe, and let vs go about other neceſſarie buſines, without the which no mortall creature can any long time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue life. The tables therefore being ſpred, and furniſhed with many daintie diſhes, <hi>Felicia</hi> tooke
<hi>Crimine</hi> and <hi>Stela</hi> by the hands, and caried them out of the meadowe to a fine ſpring, where <hi>Stela</hi> being waſhed, ſhe apparelled them as richly as their woorthines and beautie deſerued, for ſhe had commanded ſome garments ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be brought thither, knowing what would enſue, and then they returned by and by to the fountaine, (for now they were tarying for her) althings being in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines againſt her comming.
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> &amp; the Nymphes beauties were ſo ecclipſed at
<hi>Stelas</hi> comming, as the cleere ſtars at the riſing of the radiant Sunne, whereat all <pb n="217" facs="tcp:23115:113"/>of them did not a little woonder, the women, not without great emulation, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring yet to comfort themſelues, by putting ſome defect therein, although indeede there was not any at all, which (when they coulde finde any ſuch) they ſtudied to picke it elſe-where, as out of the baſenes of her eſtate, or to attribute it to ſome other things, that they (with inquiring and talking amongſt themſelues) are commonly wont to helpe and flatter theirs withall. But now (ſaide
<hi>Felicia</hi>) you may laugh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed at <hi>Pariſiles</hi> embracements, and you ſhall ſee, if we did with good cauſe finde fault with him for conioyning his reuerend viſage with ſo foule a face. Then
<hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles</hi> roſe vp, and began to embrace <hi>Stela</hi> a new, ſaying. O my daughter, now do I ſee thee like thy ſelfe, and in the habite of thine owne eſtate and deſerts. The vnknowne Shepherd marking all this, his colour in his face went and came, not bicauſe hee ſawe
<hi>Stela</hi> in ſo braue a habite, for his affection did not augment with the brauerie, nor value of her coſtly garments, neither did his loue diminiſh with the baſenes of her paſtorall habite; but for the remembrance of that time, when he had ſeene her in like ornaments. His colour changed alſo for enuy of <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> thinking that thoſe imbracings were more proper and due to him. But <hi>Felicia</hi> muſt needes come once againe to put olde <hi>Pariſiles</hi> and <hi>Stela</hi> aſunder, which done, they went to dinner. To tell the maner and order of their libationes, which they made before they went to dinner, and to deſcribe the preparation, order and diuerſitie of daintie meſſes, as things too prolixe, I thinke beſt to omit.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen dinner was done, all of them being very deſirous to know what theſe Shepherdeſſes and the vnknowne Shepherd was, &amp; for what cauſe <hi>Pariſiles</hi> ſhewed himſelfe ſo incenſed againſt him, Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> for his owne deſire, and at the requeſt of his beloued
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> and the Nymphes and Shepherds, praied <hi>Felicia</hi> in her eare, to intreat it of them; whom <hi>Felicia</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſaying: By this requeſt I might demand of them a thing which I aſſure you, they themſelues cannot tell, for the vnknowne Shepherd, and the faire Shepherdeſſe knowe not who they are, howe can they then make any report of themſelues? And it is not now poſſible for you to know the courſe of their liues, for they are heere in the preſence of old <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> before whom they dare not vnfold it. But yet leaue this charge to me, &amp; I will find out ſome means to ſatisfie you heerein. I coulde tell it better then they, (better I ſay) touching the certaine knowledge who they are: Neuertheleſſe I meane that you ſhall heare it from their owne mouthes, who can better expreſſe their owne affections, as thoſe that they paſſed themſelues. When <hi>Felicia</hi> had anſwered thus, Lord
<hi>Felix</hi> made ſignes to her to ſpeake no more of the matter for that time, whereupon all of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, perceiuing it was moſt conuenient to be ſo. But hauing nowe repoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a little after dinner,
<hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide vnto the vnknowne Shepherd. Shewe theſe Shepherds thy ſheepe-hooke, and view it well, for it deſerueth well to be ſeene. The Shepherd then roſe vp for it, for he had laid it aſide with his ſcrip, when he ſat <pb n="218" facs="tcp:23115:114"/>downe to dinner. And giuing it to the Sepherds, and Lord <hi>Felix</hi> ſeeing it of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent colour, requeſted onely to ſee of what woode it was, for from a very little ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the principall was not deuided, which might be from the middes of the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell vpward, which was wrought all ouer, and carued very fine, and from one ſide thereof (I ſay) this caruing was not ſeene, by reaſon of the fine workemanſhip. But when Lord <hi>Felix</hi> holding it in his hande, viewed the ſheepehooke well, he ſaide. Why wouldeſt thou haue the Shepherds (good Lady) onely enioy the ſight of this ſheepehooke? Bicauſe it is a thing (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) more properly apperteining to their eſtate. And me thinkes (ſaide Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) it may well beſeeme a Prince his hands, though it is well enough beſtowed, where it is. If I am of any woorth amongſt ſo good a companie as this (ſaide the Shepherd) I will not gainſay you, neither is it my minde, to pay you with the ſame money, leaſt my baſe wordes might diminiſh your high deſerts. Nowe was Lord
<hi>Felix</hi> anſwering, when <hi>Felicia</hi> reached foorth her hand, ſaying. Heere take it, and view it well. Then came the Shepherds
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> and <hi>Syluanus</hi> to Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> to looke vpon the curious ſheepehooke; Which was all blacke with ſome white ſpots, and the women ſtaied to looke on it afterwardes. They varied amongſt themſelues what wood it might be, and there were diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions concerning the ſame. Some of them ſaid it was the wood of <hi>Aloës,</hi> others of <hi>Ebony;</hi> and in the end concluded, that it was the roote of an
<hi>Olife,</hi> which was verie like to both. Then they began to view the ſheepe-hooke well, which was of length, as much as a man of meane ſtature to the breaſt; from the part beneath to the mids of the head, and from the part aboue in the ſteele a handfull length: it was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with copper, which ſhined like gold, ſo finely laid in, and ſo euen with the wood, that if it were not for the different colour, the ſtaffe might hardly haue beene diſcerned from the metall. Then from the metall in the ſteele, without any worke, two ſtrikes went downe as broad as two barley cornes: the reſt of the pommell of the ſheepe-hooke was deuided into fower peeces in bredth, by fower pedeſtals, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Cannyons, Chaptrees, Architrees, Friſes, and Corniſhes. And yet bicauſe all reached not to the ſteele (for all the fower pillars vpheld it) vpon euerie one was a little child, holding forth his arme, and lifting vp one leg, the better to reach it with his hand, and to ſupport the ſteele of it. Betweene pillar and pillar were fower little figures verie finely wrought, ſo that there were ſixteene carued peeces in all the Pommell: But betweene euerie pillar, one onely fable was carued, belonging to ſheepe or Shepherds, bicauſe it was a hooke for a Shepherd. In the peece that was firſt offered to their ſight, was a goodly white Bull in a heard amongſt many other Buls and Cowes, a fairer Bull then all the reſt, and with white hornes (for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man helped himſelfe by the white ſtreakes of the wood, when he had any occaſion) whereon
<hi>Europa</hi> was putting a garland of flowers, which ſhe tooke from her owne head; the Bull lying gently, ſtanding quietly, &amp; licking her garments, to aſſure hir the more of his gentlenes. A litle before that was ſhe ſitting vpon the Buls back, who by little and little (making as though he went feeding) roſe vp. Aboue the firſt of theſe two peeces, the Bull, turning his head, licked the Damſels handes that rodde vpon him, and pace by pace went towardes the ſea ſhore that was hard by, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting now and then his foore into the water. Aboue the ſecond figure of his firſt ſpace, the Bull leapt indeede into the ſea before him: vpon whoſe backe the Damſell ſitting with great feare, and not regarding her wette and drenched garmentes, thought good to holde faſt by his hornes, to ſaue her ſelfe from falling, turning her pitifull face (and wrinkled for feare) to the ſhore, which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:23115:114"/>ſhee was forced to leaue. When they had behelde this peece, turning the ſheepe-hooke a little about, they ſawe in the ſecond peece of it a goodly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd amongſt a flocke of ſheepe, wearing vpon his yellow lockes a bande of fine white ſilke looſe, to tie them vp on either ſide, bicauſe they might not hang downe about his eies. Whom (for that a little before he was more earneſtly, and with more brightnes beholding the Moone) they knew to be <hi>Endimion.</hi> In the vpper part thereof, they ſaw the ſelfeſame man lying vpon the maſſie body of a tree (cut down) and the Moone with her artes &amp; power endeuouring to caſt him into a deepe ſleepe. The intent why ſhe had to make him ſleepe, was vnderſtoode by that which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, for when he was aſleepe, ſhe was louingly kiſſing the faire youth. In the thirde part, or ſpace of it, was the Goddeſſe
<hi>Iuno</hi> talking with a Shepherd that had a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred eies, (named
<hi>Argus</hi>) pointing with her finger to a faire white heyfer, which ſhe commanded him to keepe well, and threatning him, if he did otherwiſe. The ſame <hi>Argus</hi> a little farther was ſitting vpon a rocke, with his ninetie eight eies (which then watched) looking ſtedfaſtly vpon the heyfer that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to his charge. In the vpper peece <hi>Mercurie</hi> was paſſing by in a ſhepherds habite, playing on a Baggepipe, who being inuited by <hi>Argus</hi> to ſit downe and reſt him, at the ſweetenes of his muſicke, all his eies fell aſleepe. A little before that,
<hi>Argus</hi> being killed by <hi>Mercurie,</hi> he caried the heyfer away, or (to ſay more properly) <hi>Io</hi> transformed into a heyfer, and gaue her to
<hi>Iupiter.</hi> In the fourth part, in <hi>Xanthus</hi> riuer bankes was
<hi>Alexander</hi> engrauen, who was afterwards called <hi>Paris,</hi> caſting his left arme about a Nymphes necke (called <hi>Enone</hi>) and with his right hande caruing theſe letters in a poplar, the ſmooth barke whereof ſerued him for paper, and a ſharpe knife for pen and inke.
<q>
                     <l>First ſhall theſe christ all ſtreames their courſes backward mooue,</l>
                     <l>Before I will forget my ſweete and deerest Loue.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A little farther was the Nymph with this Shepherd among'ſt the boughes of a lowe Tamariſque, deſpoyling the harmleſſe Nightingale of her deereſt pretie ones, and the ſorrowfull Dame fluttering vp and downe ouer their heads, and, for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, crying for vengeance to the impartiall heauens. In the peece aboue, <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> was ſhewing
<hi>Paris</hi> (who from that time tooke this name) a golden apple, poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it with a wande in his hand, to giue it to the faireſt of thoſe three Goddeſſes that came with him. A little before this were the three Goddeſſes ſtripping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues naked at <hi>Paris</hi> command, the better to giue his iudgement, and after hauing viewed them on euery ſide, and each ones ſeuerall beautie, he gaue it to <hi>Venus,</hi> who remained very proud and loftie by obtayning the prize, and the other two hanging downe their heads with ſadde countenances, and angry againſt the Shepherd. In the ſteele of it diuers artificiall ſports were carued, and ſundry kindes of huntings, not to be told or written heere, to auoide tediouſnes. Although Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> and the Shepherdes, <hi>Seluagia,</hi> and the Nymphes euery one by themſelues viewed the ſheepehooke, yet <hi>Pariſiles</hi> would neuer take it in his hands, bicauſe it belonged to that Shepherd, whom he hated aboue althings in the worlde. After they had ſeene and marked the ſheepehooke well, and commended the fine workemanſhip and deuiſes of it,
<hi>Syrenus</hi> asked the Shepherd, if he himſelfe had made it. The Shepherd anſwered no, nor knew by whom it was made, but onely him, that gaue it him. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he meant thee no ill (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) when he gaue thee ſo rich a gift as this. Nay rather (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) he that gaue it him, was euen then, and yet is the moſt mortall <pb n="220" facs="tcp:23115:115"/>enimie he hath, and gaue it him to as cruell an intent and purpoſe, as was euer heard of, bicauſe it might haue beene the meanes to haue brought this Shepherd to a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and vntimely death, as it hath beene the occaſion not onely of his baniſhment and ours, but alſo of the cruell impriſonment of his deereſt friend. At theſe words the Shepherd <hi>Stela,</hi> and
<hi>Crimine</hi> could not hold their teares, whereupon they would aske them no more of that matter. But <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide. I knowe my friend
<hi>Pariſiles,</hi> that it greeues this yoong people, that you and I are heere, who hauing reſpect and reuerence to our age, cannot conuerſe togither with ſuch diſcourſes as are moſt agreeable to their mindes, and common amongſt yoong folkes: Let vs therefore giue them place, if you thinke it beſt, and go and talke togither, for our paſtimes ſhall be no leſſe delightfull vnto vs then theirs to them. But bicauſe they are a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious kinde of people, <hi>Stela</hi> and <hi>Crimine</hi> ſhall go with vs. They laughed all at theſe laſt words, and then without more adoe,
<hi>Felicia,</hi> and they three went walking out of that meadow. But as they were going (being a little way from the fountaine, where moſt of the company was) <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaide to them that went with her. Staie heere a little, for I haue forgotten to warne them of one thing: wherefore being come backe to the fountaine, ſhe ſaide to the vnknowne Shepherd. Since I haue to talke with <hi>Pariſiles</hi> about a matter concerning thee, thy friend, and the content of you all, my departure from hence is to withdrawe <hi>Pariſiles, Crimine,</hi> and <hi>Stela</hi> from this place, bicauſe thou maiſt the better report to them that ſtaie heere with thee, who thou art, or (at the leaſt) as much as thou knoweſt of thy ſelfe, &amp; why, and how thou didſt bring ſo good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with thee; for as they greatly deſire to heare it, ſo ſhall I thinke thou doſt much for me, if thou wilt affoord me and them this content. When ſhe had ſaid thus, ſhe went backe againe to her companie, which ſhe left ſtaying for her, with whom ſhe walked to a ſecret place, where ſitting downe, ſhe ſaide. Sit downe
<hi>Pariſiles,</hi> and daughters forbeare vs a little, or elſe go walke vp and downe there, for I will not haue you beare witnes of the loue that I haue to impart to <hi>Pariſiles.</hi> They two therefore remaining all alone,
<hi>Felicia</hi> told him all that heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall be rehearſed, and that he ſhould not take it in ill part, that his daughter went in the Shepherds companie; for ſuch an one he was, by whom nothing ſhould be loſt, and the rather, ſince he had entertained her, and her loue with the greateſt puritie, and ſinceritie in the worlde. And that he ſhoulde expect, that all things ſhould ſucceede by a preordinate courſe from the Gods, which we cannot attaine to (ſaide ſhe) in bare conceite, conſidering that they for the moſt part giue to thoſe whom they loue, wiſhed eaſe and content, when they thinke themſelues fartheſt from it. Theſe and many other things did ſhe diſcourſe with him. But the vnknown Shepherd, that ſtaied in the companie of Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena,</hi> the Nymphes, and the Shepherdes (<hi>Felicia</hi> being gone) began thus to ſaie.</p>
               <p>TOuching the firſt thing you demaund of me (noble Lord, and the reſt) to tell you who I am, I know not how to reſolue you therin, for that not many yeeres ſince I knew theſe parts (my parents not being thoſe whom I tooke them to be) and with deſire to know who they were, I came with a certaine friend of mine (the halfe part of mine owne ſoule) out of our ſuppoſed owne countrey. The Gods made him and me not onely in body, face, and condition, but in fortune, and maner of life ſo like, that it might be ſaid, they gaue vs two ſoules for one bodie, or two bodies for one ſoule: and ſo he knoweth no more nor leſſe then my ſelfe, who his father or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is. We beleeued we were brethren, but that in diſtinct places, &amp; with different <pb n="221" facs="tcp:23115:115"/>perſons we were brought vp: I, with a yoong and courteous Shepherd; he, with an old and reuerend Shepherdeſſe. I (who am called <hi>Delicius</hi>) was brought vp in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle village in
<hi>Tinacria,</hi> in the corner called <hi>Pachinus,</hi> and in the houſe of a Shepherd (called <hi>Carpoſtus</hi>) my friend (whoſe name is
<hi>Parthenius</hi>) in another village in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond corner of one of the three which that Iland hath (called <hi>Pelorus</hi>) in the houſe of another Shepherd called <hi>Sarcordus.</hi> From this baſe eſtate fortune lifted vs vp on high, wherein we liued a while: but bicauſe you may heare the braue and ſtrange meanes, whereby our good or ill hap did guide vs to it, I will now tell it you, wherein I muſt aduiſe you to carrie the names of my deere friend and mine in memorie, as alſo of our nurſes, if you will delight you with the rare accident. It happend that <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> my nune (I being then but three yeeres old) went about certaine buſines to the place where my
<hi>Parthenius</hi> was nurſed, who ſeeing him play with other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the ſtreet, ſtood halfe amazed, thinking it was I (ſo like were we to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and that from out ſome Cannon I had beene ſhot into that place: but yet he maruelled more, when the child (after he was come to him, &amp; had kiſſed him againſt his will) with his weake forces endeuored to winde himſelfe from him. At the crie that <hi>Parthenius</hi> gaue, his nurſe came out, and with ſharpe wordes blamed <hi>Carpoſtus,</hi> who not ſo patiently endured her, but that he had offered (had it not beene for ſome of the towneſmen which came running out at that noyſe) to haue rudely intreated her. But he ſtill affirmed obſtinately that it was his child, and made ſuch adoe about it, that of all of them there he was reputed for a man out of his wits. In the end <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtus</hi> held his peace, ſeeing it was no point of wiſedome to be oppoſite againſt the whole towne, who affirmed with one voice, that it was the child of that woman: and ſeeing moreouer, that the child ranne away from him (which more perſwaded him to the contrarie of that, which he thought in his minde) he was content to be quiet. But the more he viewed the childes face, handes, qualities, geſture, age, and ſtature, the more he found himſelfe incredulous: And ſo much, that he could not otherwiſe thinke, but that the woman had bewitched them al, or that he was ſurely in a dream. To be briefe, he returned as ſoone (as he could) to his owne towne in great feare and doubt not to haue found me there. But the ioy, that he conceiued in ſeeing me (when he came home) and with what a glad countenance I ranne vnto him, as I was wont to doe, made no leſſe alteration in his minde: the which my nurſe <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, with a moderate laughter ſaid vnto me. It is not long ſince (my childe) thou didſt denie me: for children &amp; ſons our nurſes called vs, requeſted by them ſo to do, that did firſt put vs to them to be brought vp. And comming to his wife, he asked her if I had beene at any time from home ſince his departure, who anſwered no but ſome little while, when I went to play with other children abroad. But why ſaid ſhe? <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> then told her all that had happened, at which ſtrange noueltie ſhe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not a little, and more when he told her of the great reſemblance of vs both. And who would indeed haue laughed hartily at the deceite, but that her husband grew verie penſiue and ſad: which ſhe conſidering well with her ſelfe, asked him if any other thing had happened vnto him, or what the matter was; for if it were no more but that, he might haue greater cauſe to be glad (ſhe ſaid) then ſorrie. <hi>Carpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> anſwered, that he had made ſo great adoe in the towne, affirming it was his childe, that they might iuſtly iudge him for a ſenceleſſe and drunken foole. After my nurſe
<hi>Calaſta</hi> (for ſo ſhe was called, who was euer accounted ſuttle and wiſe) had thought a little vpon the matter, ſhe reſolued vpon this which you ſhall now heare. And thus it was. My nurſe <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> and his wife carried me cloſely (bicauſe <pb n="222" facs="tcp:23115:116"/>I might not beé ſeene) to the towne where <hi>Parthenius</hi> was brought vp, where, being verie priuately kept, and <hi>Calaſta</hi> tarying with me ſecretly at the Inne, <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> went againe to ſeeke out little
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> and hauing founde him, beganne to wrangle as before, affirming ſtill it was his ſonne, and that hee woulde prooue it before the beſt in the towne, or anie Iuſtice elſe, when as moſt of the towneſ-men (that had flocked togither to ſee his madnes the other time before) were laughing againe at his headleſſe folly, that nowe yet another time hee ſtoode ſtiffely in his former errour: who neuertheleſſe tooke away the childe <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and (for all that they could do to the contrarie) running as faſt as euer he could, caried him home to the Inne. It was woorthie the ſight, to ſee how he caried the childe, that cried out amaine, and how the people ranne after him, fearing leaſt (like a frantike man) he would haue done it ſome harme. The bruite whereof being ſpred abroad, <hi>Sarcordus,</hi> nurſe vnto <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ranne vp and downe in a great heate to ſeeke <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> out, fearing leaſt ſome harme might befall to his little childe. And hauing quickly found him in talke with other people in the ſtreet, (for by this time he had left the childe priuily with <hi>Calaſta</hi> and me) he woulde faine haue had a blowe or two with him; but that the diſſuaſions of his neighbours ſtaied his vnbrideled furie, as alſo for the gentle and milde words that
<hi>Carpoſtus</hi> gaue him: who knowing him to be his father (father he called him, for he knew him for none other) ſaide thus vnto him. Good-man of the childe, whether he be thine (as thou ſuppoſeſt) or mine (as I certainly know it) feare not, but that he is well enough, and without any harme at all. To returne him backe to thee, ſhall be as we can either of vs make our beſt proofe before the iudge: So that if the childe be thine, heere am I, that will reſtore him as ſafe and ſound as I tooke him away; if he ſhall be iudged to be mine (whereof I doubt not) thou needeſt not care for his ſafetie, (if thou doſt not meane (at the leaſt) to care for other mens matters.) Theſe wordes of <hi>Carpostus</hi> liked all the towneſmen well, not bicauſe they doubted one whit of the wrong, that he offered the other, but to heare his reaſons, which he grounded vpon a thing ſo much without reaſon. For proofe whereof much people flocked togither with either of them in preſence of the Iuſtices, before whom <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> being come, in this ſort began to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>As I am aſſured (graue Iudges) before my cauſe ſhall be fully iuſtified before you, that you will take me for a man depriued of my wits, (you being informed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by mine aduerſarie to the contrarie of my demande, and by the towneſmen of of this preſent accident) by wilfully oppugning a thing cleerer (as you thinke) then noone day: So when my manifeſt right is but with indifferent iuſtice ratified before your impartiall eares, I doubt not, but his falſe ſuppoſall ſhall be vtterly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and my iuſt demaund apparantly prooued. Whereupon (bicauſe the matter may be more rightly ſcanned and determined) reuerend Iudges you muſt know, that a fewe daies ſince I was depriued (to ſpeake more modeſtly) of a little ſonne, and (thinking leaſt of all of ſuch a wickednes, as the thing to be moſt ſtrange) hauing not long before left him in my houſe at my departure, and comming hither with all the haſte I could, found him vnawares in this towne playing with other children in the ſtreete, onely referring it to your tender conſideration (that haue louing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) what I might iuſtly feele, when leauing him (as I ſaide) at home a little before, I founde him on the ſudden in ſo diſtant a place: whereupon (as I did but the part of a louing father) by taking him away, ſo was I iudged of all men to be a madde and ſenceleſſe man. Seeing my ſelfe mocked and iniured by them for demanding mine <pb n="223" facs="tcp:23115:116"/>owne, I diſſembled the matter for that time, bicauſe I would not be ſuch an one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, by wilfully reſiſting a whole towne: But nowe with witneſſes I come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend my cauſe, which accuſtomed proof, if perhaps you wil not allow, as inſufficient, or call their ſinceritie in ſuſpicion of my ſuppoſed right, for better proofe and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thereof, I meane (by your permiſſion) to make my claime in ſuch ſort, as ſhall beſt pleaſe mine aduerſarie; whereby I thinke not onely to conuict him, but alſo to make the ſtanders by beleeue, their opinions to be as falſe, as their words iniurious, that they haue vniuſtly conceiued and vttered againſt me: So that, command mine aduerſarie (moſt rightfull Iudges) to chooſe out ſome way or other to try the truth, if yet (at the leaſt) he claimeth this childe in controuerſie to be his ſonne. To this <hi>Sarcordus</hi> anſwered thus. The matter brought heere before you (moſt reuerend and iuſt Iudges) being accounted of all moſt bad of it ſelfe &amp; moſt vntrue, I thinke ſo farre vnfit (for the high reſpect due vnto you) to trouble your graue eares withall, that were it not by the diſſuaſion of my friends, but eſpecially by the due regarde of iuſtice (wherein he falſely claimes to haue the onely title) and by maintaining of the kings inuiolate peace (whereof I am a member) this controuerſie had beene (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling you) long ſince decided. But ſince for iuſtice he cals and cries, which (though ſuppoſed) is not woont to be denied any here, I was content to condeſcend to his owne requeſt, aſſuredly knowing when by your graue cenſures the matter ſhal be thorowly ſcanned, to ouercome him with his owne weapons. All which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you muſt either iudge this man a very foole in that he ſpeakes (and as I meane to prooue him no leſſe) or elſe thinke, that he comes to importune and mocke you, procuring you come to iudgement of a matter cleerer then the brighteſt light. But bicauſe his impudencie may be thorowly knowen, and that you may inflict due puniſhment vpon him for it, Commaund him, I beſeech you, to bring hither the childe, which with the teſtimonie of all the towne I will prooue to be mine. If this proofe be ſufficient (ſaid <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> interrupting him) I will alſo prooue it by the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme voice of all my towne to be as well mine. Why then graue Iudges (ſaid <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordus</hi>) we will no longer detaine you heere about this matter. Let the childe be brought and ſet betweene vs both, and let him be deemed the right Father to whom it will goe. <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> (for that was the thing he moſt of all deſired) immediately an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Beare witnes all good people what he ſaith. And depriue him (graue Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) of a Sonne, whom the childe ſhall forſake, and let not the offender &amp; condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perſon eſcape vnpuniſhed: he, for his theft committed; me, for my folly &amp; ſhame that is ſpread abroad of me. When hee had ſpoken theſe wordes, he turned him about to a boy that he brought with him on purpoſe, and ſaid vnto him. Run to the Inne and bring the child hither, who brought me ſtraight waies thither, leauing <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> ſtill in the Inne, whoſe coats I did then weare, for <hi>Calaſta</hi> my nurce had taken off his to put them vpon me, and in chaunge of them, had put mine vpon him. But now when I was come neere, the people made way, <hi>Sarcordus</hi> ſtanding on the one ſide, and <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> on the other. Then the boy that carried me in his armes, brought me in ſight of them both, and I with a merrie countenance (being called by the name of louing ſonne) ran to my Father, not turning ſo much as mine eies to <hi>Sarcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> who was with great griefe &amp; anguiſh of minde calling in vaine vpon me. This being done to the great wonder of all the towne (for there was none there that durſt not haue laid his head, but that I was <hi>Parthenius</hi>) <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> tooke me vp and ſet me neere to <hi>Sarcordus</hi> (himſelfe going away) but I ranne by and by after him, making no account at all of <hi>Sarcordus.</hi> At this ſight, as they were all aſtoniſhed, ſo were they <pb n="224" facs="tcp:23115:117"/>not able to ſay any thing els, but that <hi>Carpostus</hi> had bewitched me, and therefore took him for ſom co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iurer &amp; wicked perſon. But firſt they brought <hi>Sarcordus</hi> his wife to ſee if I would ſeeme to faune more on her (being (as they thought) mother vnto me) then on him, of whom (to be ſhort) I made no more account then of <hi>Sarcordus.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Carpostus</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Sarcordus</hi> and all the ſtanders by. Why men of ſence and reaſon dote you thus? Be aſſured the child knowes his owne Father well enough. Commaund him therefore (I beſeech you righteous Iudges) to offer no violence to me for carrying away what is mine owne. The Iudges not knowing what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in ſo doubtfull a caſe, <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> ſaid. I know not (graue Iudges) why in a matter ſo manifeſt as this, you ſhould ſuſpend your iuſt iudgment, but that without delay you ſhould proceed to definitiue ſentence, vnles you ſeem to make any more doubt herein, which if you doe, I will cleere it, if it pleaſe you to ſend the child backe againe to my lodging by this boy, who ſhall incontinently returne with him againe; for whom I will in the meane time remaine heere a pledge, bicauſe it ſhall not be ſaide, that I tooke poſſeſſion of him before ſentence giuen. That being graunted him, he willed the boy that brought me (but ſecretly in his eare) to carrie me backe, and to bring the other childe, not forgetting to put on his owne coats, who did it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently, and hauing brought <hi>Parthenius</hi> there before them all, without any more adoe, he ranne to his Father <hi>Sarcordus,</hi> and to his knowen nurſe <hi>Sarcordus</hi> wife. The Iudges ſeeing ſo ſtrange an alteration, and thinking he did what he liſted with the child (for they tooke me and <hi>Parthenius</hi> to be both one) commaunded to lay hands on him for a notable Sorcerer. To whom <hi>Carpostus</hi> (ſeeing whereabout they went) ſaid. Though here I am (worthie Iudges) at your diſpoſition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, yet do me this fauour (I beſeech you) to ſuſpend your doome, vntill you ſee the end of this matter; it may be you will delight your ſelues with the conueiance &amp; rare ſequele of it. And then he bad the boy carrie back the child, commaunding him ſoftly in his eare to bring me and the other childe backe againe, but both naked. And this he deuiſed, becauſe
<hi>Parthenius</hi> might not be knowen by his coats. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cam, he requeſted the Iudges to command <hi>Sarcordus</hi> &amp; his wife to go aſide, or to put themſelues amongſt the preaſe of the people, ſo that the child, when he was commight not ſee them. They did ſo, &amp; behold we were both broght naked thither, and playing togither, at the ſight whereof the ſtanders by maruelled verie much, and they that came to behold the fame of that which was paſt, wondring yet a great deale more; and others, that came after vs in the ſtreetes, looking vpon one another in ſigne of admiration ſpake not a word, but opened their hands, and ſometimes lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp their eies to heauen in token of great wonder &amp; admiration. Then with a loud voice <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> (before we came) ſpake thus. One of theſe children is mine, the other is <hi>Sarcordus</hi> his. Let him therefore take his owne. But bicauſe the child by ſeeing him, may not know him, let him come to claime him behinde the people, and I will alſo hide me heere.
<hi>Sarcordus</hi> being therefore come in manner aforeſaide, and not able to diſcerne which was his, my nurſe ſaide. Now do you ſee (graue Iudges and good people aſſembled to behold the ende of this debate) howe I haue this day (to delight you with a rare noueltie) preſented before your eies the ſtrangeſt wonder in the world, bicauſe you might not woonder at me, nor repute me for ſuch a foole, as you haue taken me, for that which theſe fewe daies paſt I haue done with <hi>Partheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> beleeuing he was my ſonne, and bicauſe you might ſee, whether I had iuſt cauſe to claime him with aſſurednes for mine owne or not. They were all paſſing glad to ſee this ſtrange concluſion, and tooke him for a very wiſe man, in that he had ſo well <pb n="225" facs="tcp:23115:117"/>contriued the matter to ſaue his credit: And with great reaſon (ſaide Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) though all was done (in my opinion) by <hi>Calastas</hi> counſell, albeit I cannot alſo other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thinke, but that <hi>Carpoſtus</hi> was very wiſe by knowing how to gouerne himſelfe ſo well againſt the whole towne. When he had ſaide thus, <hi>Delicius</hi> proceeded in his diſcourſe ſaying. They put on our garments againe, and to giue either their owne, was no leſſe variance, and as great difficultie as before; for if we of our ſelues had not made our ſelues knowne to our nurſes (either of vs going to his owne) we might haue both gone naked home againe. But from that time we entred both into ſuch a mutuall league of amitie, that by no meanes they coulde part vs aſunder: for much force had one God (I knowe not) that reigned in vs, ouer each others ſoule, diuining the great and inuiolable friendſhip that ſhould be betweene him and me. I feare me (noble Sir, and the reſt) that you would a good while ſince haue asked me what was become of my deere brother <hi>Parthenius</hi> (for ſo we euer called one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and other queſtions that you haue left of, not to interrupt mee in my tale.
<hi>Delicius</hi> would haue paſſed on farther but his falling teares would not permit him. Wherefore <hi>Cynthia</hi> came to him, ſaying. Drie vp thy teares (Shepherd) and tell on thy tale, for by doing this, thou ſheweſt the ſmall confidence and hope thou haſt in my Lady <hi>Felicias</hi> helpe, whereas I my ſelfe haue alſo diuers times tolde thee before that thy ſorrowes ſhall be remedied. <hi>Delicius</hi> then wiping his eies, ſaide. Thou tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt me (O Nymph) by that which I ſhew, the ſmall truſt I haue in <hi>Felicia;</hi> but I tell thee, that by thy ſpeech, thou doſt manifeſt how little thou art acquainted with my greefe, and how leſſe thou knoweſt of like paſſions, to which knowledge I wiſh thou maieſt neuer attaine, ſince ignorance in ſuch matters is much more expedient. I could tell thee much about theſe effects, if I thought not to offende this woorthie companie: but onely one word I will tell thee. <hi>That hope doth not pardon the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, although it doth lighten it a little.</hi> But thou ſeemeſt Shepherde (ſaide <hi>Polydora</hi>) to know the very ſecrets of our harts, bicauſe (as thou haſt tolde true touching the deſire we had to know what was become of thy deere brother) thou didſt chaunce to ſay, that we would not giue thee leaue for anſwers and replies: wherefore diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thy greefe for a while, tell out the reſt as thou haſt begun. With a good will, ſaide <hi>Delicius.</hi> But let it not greeue you (woorthie perſonages) if you heare not now of my beloued brother, conſidering, that the great greefe which I ſuffer for him, muſt nowe ſuffice, and that the proceſſe of my hiſtorie ſhall in conuenient place declare it amplie vnto you; and if not ſo, at ſome other time you ſhall know it, when you ſhall ſee what great reaſon I haue to ſolemnize ſuch a memory with theſe and many more teares. The fame of this ſtrange accident (I told you of) and of our great likenes within a fewe daies after came to the eares of old <hi>Synistius,</hi> gouernour of the kingdome where we were borne, who was placed there by <hi>Rotindus</hi> king of
<hi>Eolia,</hi> for the which cauſe <hi>Syniſtius</hi> commanding, that wee ſhould be brought vnto him (as well for our great likenes, as for the great beautie which we were reported to haue when we were children) tooke vs from our fathers, and not long after ſent vs to <hi>Rotindus,</hi> who alſo hearing that rare report, which fame had blowen abroad of vs, ſent for vs to keepe
<hi>Agenestor</hi> his nephew companie, to whom he was Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the mothers ſide, being then but one yeere yoonger then vs both. As it was ſtrange to ſee what intenſiue loue euery one did beare vs, ſo were the vnſpeakable fauours and affection, which the yoong prince <hi>Agenestor</hi> ſhewed vs, ſo great, that needes we muſt (to content him) lie altogither in one chamber; for whoſe ſake, like

               <p>Hauing made an end of her ſweete ſong, &amp; perceiuing that ſhe came not againe, we roſe vp ſoftly to ſee, who had ſo much ioyed the Foreſt, filling it with ſo ſweete harmonie. But caſting our eies to the place from whence the delicate voice came, a ſudden noyſe and ruſhing of the riuer waters hard by, made vs ſuddenly looke that way. The cauſe whereof was the paſſage of a moſt fierce Shepherd that in great haſte came wading thorow the riuer. He was of ſtature ſo huge and high that no common tall man might reach with his head aboue his middle, to whoſe high and maine growth each lim of his bodie was proportionablie correſpondent. In euerie part he was ſo hairie, that the skinne of his bodie might hardly haue beene diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if the haire (like to the briſtles of wild Boares) had not growen right forth. His eies were terrible to behold, and full of foggie fleſh; his wearing of wilde beaſtes skinnes (from whom he rent &amp; tooke them) was ſodden hard for his defence againſt their ſharpe teeth; his ſleeues came no further on his armes, then almoſt to his elbowes, and his hoſe but a little beneath his knees. On his head he ware a broad
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:23115:119"/>Shell of a ſea Tortuſe, which ſerued him for his morion. His ſcrip, that hung downe behind his ſhoulders, was made of a wild goates skinne. Almoſt a whole Pine tree, (big enough for the maſt of ſome tall ſhip) ſerued him for his ſheepe-hooke; the end whereof was poynted with ſharpe and tempered ſteele. The cauſe of his paſſing thorow the riuer in ſuch haſte, was to follow (as we afterwards perceiued) a certaine Damſell, which was ſinging the ſong (which you haue heard) on the other ſide of the riuer. Whoſe faire ſight filled vs with no leſſe wonder, then the fierce ſhew of the huge and monſtrous Shepherd with a pale and ſhiuering feare. As ſoone as the faire virgin had ſet eie on
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> (for ſo was this deformed fellow called) with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſwiftnes ſhe began to flie away, and comming to paſſe neere vnto the place where we were, we iudged her to be ſome Nymph, reſembling in face like a faire boy, or a boy transformed in countenance like to a faire Nymph: for her habit was not altogither manlike, nor in euerie point apparelled like a woman. Her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiueled haire (in brightnes ſurmounting the fine Arabian gold) in curled lockes hung dangling about her ſnow-white forehead; and from the middes of her head (which with a crowne of Laurell and ſweete coloured flowers was graced) in faire and loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> treſſes hung careleſly downe. The which being ſpread abroade vpon her euen ſhoulders, and with a ſweete ſight falling downe beneath her fine waſte, were gathered vp by the ſaid Laurell crowne, bicauſe they might not hide ſuch ſingular beautie, nor hinder the light of her radiant eies. On her bodie ſhe wore a fine little doublet of a moſt perfect purple tynſell (the like I thinke not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) the ſame being richly died, and wouen as curiouſly as art could deuiſe, and ſo fit for her ſightly bodie, that it ſeemed, it was endowed with vnderſtanding, deſiring by no meanes to be ſeuered from it; the which at her faire and ſmooth necke (for ſome greater reſpect) was ſomewhat careleſly looſe. The purple colour of this little doublet with the glimmering beames of her ſnow-white face reflecting vpon it, was repreſented with ſuch a heauenly grace, like to that orient bluſh, which a crimſon vale (pearced by the Sunnc bright beames) is wont to caſt vpon ſome white Palace. A little wind gathered by the ſpeede of her ſwift running, faſhioned a delicate lap of the ſame colour of the doublet: the white and azure border whereof came downe but a little beneath the calfe of her fine legge, when, but halfe a light greene buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin, wrought all before with flowers of golde, was diſcouered to our dazeled eies, with certaine <hi>Scarpines</hi> or ſhooes (ſuch as <hi>Mercurie</hi> (men ſay) was woont to weare) to defend her pretie foote from the iniuries of the hard ground. Within her Iuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie quiuer, that ſo ſeemely hung on her left ſhoulder, her looſe arrowes went ſhaking vp and downe. The bow ſhe carried in her left hand, with three arrowes in her right, made her in her flight more light and nimble. And in this ſort <hi>Parthenius</hi> and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde at once this ſoueraigne virgin; and both at once (as after it was knowen) were ſurpriſed with the beautie of her angelicall face: which made vs ſo farre beſides our ſelues, that both of them in a ſhort time being ouerrun vs a pretie way, we neither thought vpon hir ſuccor, nor once reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred to deliuer hir from that bruit beaſt, who was almoſt at hir fainting heels: which help admit, though awaked out of our ſudden paſſion &amp; wonder we had offered to haue lent hir; yet had we neither bin able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol <hi>Gorphoroſtes</hi> beaſtly forces, nor to com any thing neer him in running, nor yet to haue ouertaken ſaire
<hi>Stela</hi> (for this is the Soueraigne name of the noble virgine and heauenly Shepherdeſſe, that diſdaines not my companie) in her ſwift and fearefull flight. Needleſſe it had beene (ſaide Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) to tell her name, when as by thy fine deſcription and praiſes, that thou haſt giuen her, it might be eaſily coniectured <pb n="231" facs="tcp:23115:119"/>who ſhe was.

Then ſaide
<hi>Delicius.</hi> Nowe had the cruell <hi>Gorphorost</hi> blowen vp faire
<hi>Stelas</hi> haire with his firie foming breath, when ſhe, looking pale for feare to ſee him ſo nigh her, and her-ſelfe in ſo apparant danger, encouraged her fainting ſpirits (well-nie ouercome by the violent paines of her ſwift courſe) and got a little againe before him; wherewith being (happily) come to the riuers ſide, where it yeeldes his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtreames into the ſea, ſhe ſaide.

O yee partiall Gods (if there be any, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides mine owne will and appetite) yee vniuſt Gods enuiers of my good, howe would I peece-meale rent you, if I had you in my hands, to teach you not to meddle any more in my matters. And thou <hi>Neptune,</hi> who aboue the reſt art termed to haue an abſolute and ſole power ouer the waters, caſt out from thy habitations that, which of right belongs to me; otherwiſe in theſe caues and dens I will euery day diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thee and thy companie, turning theſe huge and ſteepie hils into thy waters. As he was vttring theſe proud words, we came to the riuer, where we ſawe a goodly Nymph put out her yellow head, and ſpake theſe wordes againſt <hi>Gorphorost.</hi> Thou huge and monſtrous beaſt, that, in diſhonour of the immortall Gods art vomiting out blaſphemies, hurtful to thy ſelfe, and not offenſiue to them, harke what I wil ſay vnto thee. Thou haſt now incenſed all the Gods ſo much againſt thee, that (were it not to reſerue thee for ſom greater torments) they would preſently afflict thee with due puniſhment. Trouble not thus our waters, ſince the vtmoſt of thy power is ſo little able to profite thy ſelfe, vnleſſe thou wilt alſo make vs thy principall enimies, and purchaſe our ill wils; which (thinke not) ſhall be ſmall, ſince we haue her in our cuſtodie, whom thou vnwoorthily calleſt thy Goddeſſe: We keepe her, but not for thee, who by the fates is allotted to another. She remaineth in our pallaces with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any harme, for it was not reaſon ſhe ſhould for thy fault, ſuffer any at all. And with this get thee hence, hopeleſſe for euer to ſee her in thy power, in whoſe behalſe the Gods were neuer ſo vniuſt, as to combine two ſuch vnequall perſons togither. To this <hi>Gorphorost</hi> anſwered thus. The threatnings of theſe, whom vainely thou termeſt Gods, and Goddeſſes (ſweete Nymph, the happie gardienne of my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Goddeſſe) I little account of, who neuer yet acknowledged ſubiection to any other, but to her, who (as thou ſaieſt) remaineth now in your dwelling places. And her iuſtly do I confeſſe to be mine onely Goddeſſe, and therfore feare her more then all the reſt. And it greeues me, if ſhe thinkes I went about to hurt her, to whom (I confeſſe) I neuer intended any ſuch matter. For if I ranne after her, it was bicauſe ſhe fledde from me, and would not ſtaie to harken to my iuſt complaints. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <pb n="232" facs="tcp:23115:120"/>me (Nymph) bicauſe her tenderfoote might not be harmed by ſome ſharpe thorne or flintie ſtone, thinking ſhe woulde haue moderated her flight, I followed with a ſlowe pace, entreating her ſtill to ſtaie; and telling her, that ſince the ſwifteſt Does I ouerran, and tooke in a ſhort race, ſhe might not then thinke therein to go beyond me. And this I was deſirous to tell thee, to requeſt thee (gentle Nymph) to holde mee excuſed and blameles to her. By dooing whereof, I promiſe thee to keepe thy waters euer cleere, and vndefiled: And bicauſe ſhe may vnderſtand howe much it greeues me, that I haue offended her, I will purge me of this errour in my caue, without comming once out of it, vntill this newe Moone ſhall haue runne out her full courſe. When he had ſpoken theſe words, he went his waies, &amp; the Nymph refuſing to harken to my cries, and to
<hi>Parthenius</hi> his pitifull requeſtes, diued downe againe into the waters. Which thing (if it did not greeue vs both) I leaue heerafter to your iudgements: Seeing therefore how booteleſſe it was to call her,
<hi>Parthenius</hi> turning to me (for I had firſt called the Nymph) ſaide. Brother, what wouldeſt thou haue with her? How is it poſſible (ſaide I) but that I muſt call her, ſince ſhe hath in her cuſtodie that power of beautie, that wholly poſſeſſeth my conquered hart. I came foorth (deere brother) to ſeeke out my loſt Father, and haue met with her, that hath found my ſoule. Wo is me, that know not what ſhall become of me. And from hencefoorth now thou maieſt go ſeeke out thy deere parents, which leaue (ſweete friend) I woulde not giue thee (for the Gods knowe how much thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture greeues me) but onely to content and pleaſe thee: for heere will I ſtaie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I know what the immortall Gods will determine with me. Scarce coulde my louing brother ſtande vpon his feete, when from mine owne mouth he heard that I was enamoured of the faire damſell, bicauſe he had alſo no leſſe then my ſelfe (as by a ſtrange chance I afterwards knew it) yeelded vp to her his loue and libertie. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was either my good or ill happe to manifeſt my paſſion firſt, <hi>Parthenius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his, in lieu that I might carie the guerdon away. So that on the oneſide, he was very glad, that one thing offred it ſelfe, whereby I might receiue the firſt fruits of his true friendſhip; and was ſorrie on the other, to ſee that his greefe was remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. Which perfect function of amitie I would in very truth haue no leſſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med towards him, if he had firſt opened his loue of her vnto me, as afterwards I did, though yet for all this I muſt remaine his debtor. But bicauſe I might not perceiue the great good turne he did me, and he by diſcloſing it haue loſt the merite thereof, he did not onely diſſemble it right-out, but by words and demonſtration made as if no ſuch matter had beene: And albeit he ſtriued with himſelfe not to loue <hi>Stela,</hi> yet was he not able to performe it, but (as I ſaie) hidde it in ſuch ſort, that it might not be perceiued. Whereupon to that which I had ſaide, he anſwered thus. The Gods neuer ſuffer me to profite nor pleaſure my ſelfe with ſuch a leaue, deere brother. For thou art my father &amp; mother, &amp; to forſake thee, I meane not to ſeeke them out: Let them pardon me whoſoeuer they be, for ſince they left me in my infancy, &amp; perhaps without iuſt occaſion, it ſhal be no part of impietie for me to denie them in their old age, being warranted by ſo iuſt an excuſe. Many other friendly ſpeeches paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs both, &amp; that wheron we concluded was this: To go to the next town, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe itwas late, &amp; there by ſom other courſe (if at the leaſt ſome happie meanes did obuiate our deſires) to informe vs what that Damſell was, &amp; thereupon to aduiſe vs what was beſt to be done. Comming therefore neere vnto a little towne, not farre from that place, we eſpied this reuerend old <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> almoſt in the very ſame robes that he now weares, who turned his eies on euerie ſide, to ſee if he might perceiue <pb n="233" facs="tcp:23115:120"/>her comming, for whom (it ſeemed) he had long looked and lamented. To whom in the end a certaine raunger, that a farre off came croſſing ouer the lawnes, appeared, who being come vnto him, ſpake ſome fewe words togither, but what, we could not heare, for we had hid our ſelues a prettie way off: and fewe they were. For by and by the ſorrowfull old man with a pitifull outcrie fell into a great ſwoune. The raunger ſeeing him in ſuch a trance, thinking he was dead, and fearing leaſt his ſudden death (as he thought) might haue beene laide to his charge, ran preſently away as faſt as euer he could, when as we all in vaine called and cryed out alowd vnto him; ſo that, for that time we could not know the cauſe of the good old mans ſorrow. One thing I haue noted in thy diſoourſe, ſaide Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> that thou euer with reuerence and humanitie entreateſt olde <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> who (as not long ſince it ſeemed) would haue killed thee. And with great reaſon, anſwered
<hi>Delicius,</hi> to whom I doe not onely wiſh well, becauſe he is Father to faire <hi>Stela,</hi> but honour him for his high deſerts. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to my diſcourſe, ſeeing the ranger would not ſtay, we went to the noble
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiles,</hi> who was lying (as aboueſaid) diſtraught of his ſences, and perceiuing that he came not to himſelfe again, we both went to ſeeke out ſome water to ſprinkle on his face, ech of vs going a ſundry way, to bring it the ſooner to him. Which, when after too long ſeeking (as we thought) we could not finde, we returned backe againe, and before we came to the place where we left him, we heard him lamenting in this ſort.</p>

We were no leſſe glad to heare the newes, of that we ſo much deſired to knowe, as to giue him good tidings, whom it behooued vs to make as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to vs as we could, for ſeruing our owne turnes. But as we were now deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to goe and talke with him, my brother ſaid. Let vs ſtay, for if this be Father to thy new Miſtreſſe, it is not beſt that he ſhould now knowe vs, when we our ſelues knowe not what we haue to doe, nor how our matters (not yet well commenced) will fall out. And ſince he ſaide he will goe to the riuer, there to be the miniſter of his owne death, I thinke it beſt for vs to follow him, and demanding what he ſeekes, and whither he goes, to tell him what hath paſſed; which I alſo thinke beſt to be done, when it is ſomewhat darke, bicauſe ſpeaking to him then, he may not knowe vs another time, whereas (if it might afterwards auaile vs) by knowing vs to be the ſame men that brought him theſe good newes, we ſhall not want meanes to tell him that at our owne pleaſure. We thought this to be good counſell, and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put it ſo well in practiſe, that the good olde man being thereby comforted vp a little, went backe againe, and in requitall of theſe good newes, offered me, that was the teller of them, his lodging that night.

<hi>Stela</hi> had caſt her ſelfe into the riuer, attending there her comming foorth; and being come foorth, to ſee, if we might talke with her. But before we came, we eſpied the virgins olde Father walking vp and downe along the riuer bankes: And going neerer vnto him, to ſee if he offered to caſt himſelfe into the riuer, we ſawe, how wearie of walking he ſat him downe, and then with as lowde a voice as his greefe would giue him leaue, heard him in this ſort ſinging to his dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt daughter.</p>

               <p>This beuie of faire Nymphes, when they had ended their propheticall ſong, came to the riuer ſide, and with a maruellous ſweete conſent did put into <hi>Pariſiles</hi> armes his welbeloued daughter: Betweene whom certaine ſpeeches being paſt, with great thankes to the Nymphes, they tooke their mutuall leaue, the old man going away al alone, though acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with a thouſand perplexed thoughts, &amp; ſwelling tears, that for depriuation &amp; loſſe of his deere daughter fell in great plentie from his aged face. The Nymphes to their chriſtalline aboades, and
<hi>Parthenius</hi> and I remaining <pb n="240" facs="tcp:23115:123"/>not a little ſorrowfull (as you may geſſe) for <hi>Stelas</hi> departure, and full of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for that which we heard by the Nymphes diuining ſong, being then ignorant, and doubting whether the contents thereof were ment by vs or not. All which paines, greefes, and troubles threatned therein, and many more faine woulde wee haue ſuffred, in lieu that faire <hi>Stela</hi> had beene the cauſe of them. With theſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other conſiderations reuolued in our mindes, we determined to ſtay there, to ſee if the Nymphes (taking faire <hi>Stela</hi> with them) came ſometimes foorth to ſolace themſelues amongſt thoſe greene and pleaſant forreſts: where we ſtaied not long before our deſires had part of their contentment; for euen the next day about that hower when <hi>Tytan</hi> equally viewed all our Hemiſphere, and certaine daies after came out many faire Nymphes, to paſſe away the heate amongſt thoſe coole and freſh ſhades, though their happie ſallies (happie by faire <hi>Stelas</hi> company) did little auaile vs, ſince euery time that we made offer to come out of the woode towardes them, with fearefull flight they ranne backe againe to their acquainted riuer. <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> therefore ſeeing the ſmall occaſion that was offered vs to talke with them, ſaide vnto me. With this beginning (deere brother) wee muſt not continue on our commenced purpoſe, which is not onely an open impediment to the good ſucceſſe of our determination, but a manifeſt occaſion to moleſt thy Miſtreſſe, and a let to the Nymphes from their wonted paſtime and delight. What remedie then (ſaid I) ſhall we vſe, or what doſt thou aduiſe vs to do, for I cannot by any meanes depart from hence with ſafetie of my life. As I will not counſell thee thereunto ſaide <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius,</hi> ſo the immortall Gods forbid that we go from hence, before we finde out ſome good meanes, whereby theſe Nymphes (their coyneſſe laide aſide) may admit vs into their ſweete company. If there be any remedie for this (ſaide I) then all my ſorrowes, and ſorrowful life ſhal be (I hope) both eaſed and ended; but alas my greefe will not giue me leaue to conceiue it ſo. And if there be any (ſaid <hi>Parthenius</hi>) it is but onely one. Thou knoweſt well my deere brother, by all thoſe times that wee haue ſeene them comming hither, how they do leſſe diſdaine the ſimplicitie and plainnes of countrey Shepherds, then the ſuſpicious companie of cunning courtiers, and that their turall baggepipe is more delightſome to their eares, then the enticing and wanton Lute of the others. The which dulie conſidered, it ſhall be better for vs (in my opinion) by leauing of theſe coſtly habits, to cladde our ſelues in homelie Shepherds weedes; which probable inuention being put in practiſe, may happely prooue more fortunate vnto vs, then any other courſe that we may well thinke of. His counſell, which was foorthwith put in execution, liked me ſo well, that we left of our accuſtomed apparell, and put on this which you ſee, not conſenting that garments (whom nature made ſo like) ſhould put any difference betweene vs. And ſo likewiſe we forgot not our ſheepehookes, and ſcrips, and whatſoeuer elſe belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to a Shepherds calling. But as for ſheepe, we bought none, before we knewe how well this deuiſe anſwered our deſeignes, the which, time, and occaſions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would aduiſe vs beſt to do: for we agreed to ſay, that we left them behinde, in cuſtodie of our Swaynes, and that we came before to ſeeke out the beſt paſture for them. We had alſo fidles, and pipes, whereon we ſoone learned to play, bicauſe we could plaie on the Fluet, and Vials and other muſicall inſtruments. With this new habite we paſſed away certain daies, in ſinging &amp; playing many ſundrie things: Al which felout ſo fit to our deſires, that not once, but a manie times, the Nymphes kept vs company, bringing <hi>Stela</hi> that faire and ſhining Staire many times amongſt them, by whoſe golden light the courſe of our grieuous life was then, and is yet moſt <pb n="241" facs="tcp:23115:123"/>happily guided: Wherein Fortune ſo highly fauoured me, that day by day (though much againſt my will) I accompanied thoſe faire Nymphes; not, that it was not a foueraigne glorie to me to be in preſence of that cleere Sunne I ſpake of; but bicauſe I would haue thought it a greater good, if my deere brother had alſo inioyed the ſame. This is ſtrange (ſaid Lord
<hi>Felix</hi>) to ſhew thy ſelfe on the one ſide moſt appaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate for faire <hi>Stela,</hi> &amp; to grieue on the other, that thou inioyeſt her ſight al alone, deſiring it for another. But ſtranger it would ſeeme (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) if you knew euery thing that paſſed about this matter: But now let it ſuffice you (Gentlemen and Shepherds) to know this much, and another day (it may be) I will make an ende of that I haue begun. They were all importunate with him to haue him tell on, when <hi>Felicias</hi> comming made them leaue of, who being come vnto them, ſaid to <hi>Delicius.</hi> My friend Shepherd, ſince I inioyned thee of late to a task that not ſo wel contented thee, I am now come to deliuer thee from it, bicauſe I imagine how grieuous it is to thee to paſſe therein any further. To do the contrarie good Ladie (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) were vnworthie your gracious ſelfe, and not quadrant to that, which is expected at your hands, wherein I meane not to giue you the thankes you deſerue, nor hope of any other guerdon, then that which you your ſelfe haue alreadie taken, conſidering that you do no more, then what to your owne ſelfe you are bound to do. For all this (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) let vs (my ſonnes) goe home, for <hi>Phoebus</hi> now doth haſten him to his owne, whoſe roſie beames, though ſilently they begin to decay, ſhall with his Siſters ſiluer lights, to guide our ſteps be carefully ſupplyed. And we might well paſſe away this freſh approching night, and with great pleaſure ſpend it in ſo good companie; but in the end we ſhall better take our reſt in the houſe, whereas for this day let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vs with the bootie we carie home. With a fewe ſuch walkes abroad (ſaid <hi>Feliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>) we ſhall be quickly inriched: Though in verie truth at our firſt onſet, we haue taken ſo braue a prize and robbed ſo much good, as I thinke, we ſhall not neede to take any paines to lye in waite for more.
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> had not gone away in <hi>Stelas</hi> debt, if
<hi>Felicia</hi> had not cut her off, ſaying. The faſhion in this place is not to pay by and by, but to truſt ſomething. But how comes this to paſſe, that I haue alreadie taken <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſiles, Stelas, and Crimines</hi> words to be my gueſtes, and haue not <hi>Delicius</hi> conſent to be one of them? Aduiſe thee therefore Shepherd, if it pleaſe thee to goe in with vs, for it was neuer my condition to force any againſt their wils, whereby to giue thee any occaſion to complaine of me, and to ſay that like a forced captiue I carie thee in. Your words good Ladie (ſaid
<hi>Delicius</hi>) are different from your deedes. For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould heare you ſay, that you did not perforce carie me in, would not (I thinke) beleeue your wordes: for I frankly confeſſe before them all, that you carrie me in as a priſoner, forced and taken. Wherein if they will not credit me, for themſelues (at the leaſt) they muſt needs beleeue me: for I will gage my head, that all will affirme no leſſe, and ſay, that you haue moreouer forced and made them captiue to your wil and commaund. They all laughed at <hi>Delicius</hi> anſwere, ſeeing how well he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited himſelfe of <hi>Felicias</hi> ieſt, whereupon they all told
<hi>Felicia,</hi> that the Shepherd ſaid true, and that ſhe ſhould not care for ſatisfactions with wordes. And who ſhall iudge this betweene vs (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) for I confeſſe to, that you carie me no leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and forced to your wils and deſires. But leauing this doubt to be decided, let vs go our waies. Then all of them obeying the ſage
<hi>Felicia,</hi> followed her, and with the pleaſant diſcourſes which they mooued there amongſt themſelues, made the way ſeeme leſſe and ſhorter; ſo that ſooner then they would, ſome of them came to the royall Palace. It was now well entred into night, when being come neere to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:23115:124"/>
                  <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, and <hi>Felicias</hi> Palace, a great number of faire Nymphes (being richly attired) came foorth to meete them, and euerie one with a torch of virgin waxe in her hand to light them in, thereby the rather to manifeſt the great magnificence and maieſtie of
<hi>Felicia,</hi> then for any neede of their light at all. For the moone did ſhine ſo bright, that (it ſeemed) ſhe endeuored nothing more then with her ſociable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to behold and hearken to that noble companie. They that were neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that rich Palace, maruelled to ſee the ſtately and ſumptuous buildings of it. But when vpon the chiefe portall and entrance thereinto, they ſaw two Nymphes made all of maſſie ſiluer ſtand vpon the Chaptrees of two columnes, with theſe verſes:

If the Goddeſſe of chaſtitie (bicauſe it is the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi>) delighteth onely in the companie and conuerſation of women, then muſt al men conſequently be forbidden to come in. And whereas it ſaieth, that ſhe, that in all thoſe points findes her ſelfe guiltleſſe, may come in, my deſire is to know, if any woman failing in any of them, happen to come in, what would enſue thereof. <hi>Syrenus</hi> before <hi>Delicius</hi> paſſed any further, ſaid. It is wittily demaunded, or els I vnderſtand it not: and truly my deſire is no leſſe to know, what harme would befall to her, that with breach of her firſt faith and loue entered in, thereby to warne the faithleſſe Shepherdeſſe <hi>Diana.</hi> But now another ſcruple (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) ariſeth in my mind, which is, That when we were comming towards this rich Palace, I asked one of theſe faire Nymphes, what euery one of this noble and vertuous companie might be; who briefly ſatisfying me in euerie point, amongſt other things that ſhe told me made me eſpecially to maruell at this, That ſome of theſe heere, were married in this place: Whereupon I would faine know, if in the Temples of the Goddeſſe of chaſtitie it be vſuall to ſolemnize any marriage, bicauſe that myſterie is as ſtrange to mine eares, as the reaſon therof to my conceit. If by reſoluing thee in theſe demaunds (ſaid

Hauing ſupped, they went to bed without

Right ouer againſt them on foote ſtoode a yoong Shepherd, who with the lappe of his ſide coate wiped away the teares that fell downe thicke vpon his blubbered cheekes, in requitall whereof, and of his inward greefe, the Shepherdeſſes did nothing elſe, but by looking vpon one another, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorde him a gracious ſmile.
<hi>Syrenus, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia,</hi> knowing it was the ſame Shepherd, that ſhewed them the letter, when they were going from
<hi>Felicias</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace towards their owne towne, withdrew themſelues aſide, and euery one of them doing the like, <hi>Syrenus</hi> very ſoftly ſaid. O how glad am I to ſee this yoong Shepherd here, for if he would but ſing, you ſhould ſee that the ſweetenes of his ſongs, which we haue ſo much commended to you, were no fained thing. But it greeues me not a little to ſee him in theſe termes, that he is not like to make me nowe as good as my worde. Take no care for that (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) for he will not forget to do it, and bicauſe you may heare him the better, come ſoftly on with me, for I will bring you to ſuch a place, where they ſhall not ſee you, but where you may at pleaſure delight you with his ſweete muſicke. The Shepherdeſſes were talking with the Shepherd, when
<hi>Felicia</hi> brought them as neere (vnſeene) as they could be, but yet not ſo neere, that they were able to tell what they were talking togither. More faire then curteous are thoſe Shepherdeſſes (ſaide Lord
<hi>Felix</hi>) that requeſt not the Shepherd to ſit downe by them. It is not for that (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) but for great reſpect of loue and dutie that he beareth to the yoonger, who in her preſence could neuer finde in his hart to ſit, but onely when others were in companie, from whom he thought it beſt to conceale his paſſions. Why is he ſo ſadde (ſaide
<hi>Seluagia</hi>) for as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and coulde gather by his letter, his Shepherdeſſe could not doe, nor ſay anie thing, wherein he tooke not great ioy and contentment. I, but Fortune hath nowe turned her wheele (ſaide
<hi>Felicia</hi>) for then, and euer ſince, for the reward of his loue, he onely enioyed the preſence and ſweete company of his Shepherdeſſe, the force from whence his ioyes and comforts ſprung: but now, for ſome certaine daies, he is forced to depart from her, which farewell breedeth no leſſe his preſent greeſe &amp; ſorrow. And that which giues him greater paine, is that he knowes not when hee ſhall ſee her againe. But harke and giue attentiue care, for now they command him <pb n="244" facs="tcp:23115:125"/>to ſing, whereupon they ſawe him take his Rebecke out of his ſcrip, and with a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning voice began thus to ſing.</p>

                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:23115:126"/>As he thus made an end of his ſong, they roſe vp, and the yonger (called <hi>Phillis</hi>) made a ſigne to the Shepherd with her ſinger, to reach her vp her ſcrip and Sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooke that lay on the ground, at whoſe hands (though in moſt dutifull manner he did it) ſhe receiued them with no more thankes or ſhew of courteſie, then if one of hir ſwaines had giuen it her. And then with a word or two of the Shepherdeſſes, but with his many teares the mournefull Shepherd tooke his leaue: whereat <hi>Phillis</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mooued to ſome ſmall ſorrowe and to no leſſe greefe for his departure, tooke out of her ſcrip a fine little ſpoone (the ſame perhaps that ſhe her ſelfe did eate with) and gaue it him, wherewith the Shepherd did ſomewhat mitigate his helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſorrow: and then they went out of the meadow one way, and the Shepherd another, Might it not be well done (ſaide <hi>Feliſmena</hi> to
<hi>Felicia</hi>) to talke with thoſe Shepherdeſſes before they goe. Not now anſwered <hi>Felicia,</hi> for heereafter you ſhall knowe all, when their due time ſhall come, wherein you ſhall then take as great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to ſee and conuerſe with <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Castalius</hi> (for ſo is the Shepherd called that was with them) as now perhaps ſome little greefe for their departure: whereas beſides it is not now ſo conuenient, bicauſe I knowe, we ſhould make them not a little aſhamed. The Shepherdeſſes therefore being now gone out, they went into the little meadow to the chriſtalline fountaine, where, in ſet daunces and ſweete ſongs (accompanied with pleaſanthiſtories and gracious ſpeeches) they ſpent the time till <hi>Felicia</hi> thought it good for them all to goe to the Temple, when ſhe came to warne them. Who (it ſeemed) did neuer awake, or take care for any other thing, then where, and after what maner ſhe might beſt delight that noble companie. Whereupon ſhe caried them ſometimes to the goodly plaine before the Temple, other times to another pleaſant meadow neere to the wood, and ſometimes to the Laurell fountaine. Truth it is that (to haue all poſſible ioy) Don <hi>Felix</hi> and his faire Lady
<hi>Feliſmena, Syluanus,</hi> and his louing Shepherdeſſe
<hi>Seluagia</hi> needed not to ſeeke it out in exteriour things, ſince their inwarde ioy (to ſee themſelues all fower with mutuall affection ſo happily beloued) was ſo great, that all others (in reſpect of this) were but meere ſhewes and ſhadowes. <hi>Syrenus</hi> tooke a ſingular pleaſure to beholde the contentment of them all, whom ſo vnfainedly he loued. The Nymphes not onely procured it for themſelues, but to delight them all in generall. And <hi>Pariſiles</hi> his anger being now paſt with that which <hi>Felicia</hi> had told him, and ſhaking off his former ſadnes, by enioying the preſence of his daughter, was no leſſe ioyfull then the reſt. But <hi>Stela,</hi> and <hi>Crimine</hi> were in ſuſpence, betweene ſolace and ſorrow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and care, being cheered on the one ſide by the hope that <hi>Felicia</hi> promiſed them, and by knowing that thoſe louers were onely by her meanes recured; but ſad on the other, that by imagination they could not finde out ſome way or remedie for their paines and paſſions, which were ſo ſtrange, that though to their owne content they craued it, yet they could not deuiſe how to their owne wils and deſires they might enioy it. For both of them equally loued <hi>Delicius</hi> and
<hi>Parthenius:</hi> but <hi>Stela</hi> eſpecially, who deſired not to haue
<hi>Delicius</hi> loue her, if <hi>Parthentus</hi> forgat her; nor eſteemed of <hi>Parthemus</hi> his loue, if <hi>Delicius</hi> had deſpiſed her. Onely <hi>Delicius</hi> amids ſuch ſportes and paſtimes (as were offered there) was far from all comfort, by fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe abſent from his deere friend <hi>Parthenius,</hi> without whoſe preſence he cared not to enioy his ſorrowfull life. And the danger beſides (which ſhall bee heerafter ſpoken of) wherein he knew his deere friend to be, was euery hower ſo ſenſibly repreſented to his greeuous thoughtes, that he was many times determined to goe and deliuer him, or elſe to die in that reſolution; but that he was prohibited <pb n="247" facs="tcp:23115:126"/>on the one ſide, and had no force on the other to forſake <hi>Stela,</hi> the ioy and light of his darke and mournfull life. The ſeldome enioying of whoſe woonted ſweete ſight, and diſcontinued ſpeech with her, by reaſon of old <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> applied more matter to the heauie burden of his greefe: So that he (though all the reſt did ſing and play) could neuer be perſwaded to keepe them companie, from the which but with faint and fained reaſons he for the moſt part excuſed himſelfe. Whereupon (when op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely he could do it) he cloſely conuayed himſelfe out of their company, whoſe diſcontentment (his yoong Shepherdeſſes with watchful eie perceiuing it) did not a little greeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> ſeeing how little her promiſed hope preuailed with the fearefull Shepherd, on an euening before them all ſaide thus vnto him. I woulde neuer leaue to complaine on thee (ſorrowfull yoong Shepherd) if I knewe not the great reaſon thou haſt to bee ſo ſad: And therefore I beſeech you that be heere, not to be offended with the courſe of his melancholike life; nor take it in ill part, if hee cannot pleaſure you as you woulde; praying you beſides to do me ſo much fauour, not to aske him any more, then he is willing of himſelfe to tell you, and to attende the time, when with his gratefull conuerſation and ſweete diſcourſes he ſhall fill your hands full. Of curteſie then good Shepherd, and for ſhame do no more, then what thou ſhalt ſee moſt auailing thy content, ſince we are ſo glad (by al the meanes we can) to giue it thee. Then anſwered <hi>Delicius.</hi> I can receiue no greater fauour in any thing (moſt gracious and prudent Ladie) vnleſſe it be the enioying of my <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> his preſence) then in that, which you haue alreadie done me: which eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all benefits (ſince my abilitie is ſo ſmall) muſt needs remaine without due requitall. For though in ſigne of ſubiection, my willing minde and perſon woulde bee euer ready at your command and ſeruices; yet it were but a friuolous and vndiſcreet part to promiſe you that, which by all reaſon is alreadie due vnto it. <hi>Don Felix, Feliſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Shepherds and the Nymphes with one voice ſaid, That they were not a little glad to ſee <hi>Delicius</hi> take content in any thing, who gaue them many thankes for it, crauing pardon of them for the great ſtrangenes he vſed amongſt them. At whoſe hands and of <hi>Felicia</hi> and the reſt obtaining a friendly pardon, hee paſſed away his ſorrowes all alone, going often into that thicke woode to lament his hard and ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter haps; wherein he could not chooſe but many times haue loſt himſelfe, if the ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning turrets of <hi>Felicias</hi> pallace had not brought him thither again, when he would. Amongſt many other daies, that heere and there ſome went to ſport themſelues in diuers places, it fell out that the Shepherdes <hi>Syrenus, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia,</hi> (for
<hi>Felicia</hi> and <hi>Don Felix</hi> had gone one way, and the reſt of the companie another) were one day all alone with old <hi>Pariſiles</hi> in a quadrant of the rich pallace, to whom <hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſaide. Since it hath pleaſed you woorthie <hi>Pariſiles</hi> (the fewe daies that you haue beene heere) to content all our louers with your pleaſant and amorous hiſtorie of
<hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pid</hi> their idolatrous God, my ſelfe, that haue not to do with this blinde boye, why haue you refuſed to gratifie with ſome pleaſant diſcourſe touching a Shepherds ſtate. The firſt day that we enioyed your happie companie, you propounded diuers things concerning the ſame, from that time ſurcharging me with (more then a meane) deſire to heate them diſcourſed by you: And eſpecially the manner of the ſacrifice of our God <hi>Pan,</hi> and how at the firſt it was vſed to be done, and from what time it was held in reuerence, and all the reſt that you propounded about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that your tale ſhall come nowe in good time, and to very good purpoſe, ſince we are heere all Shepherds and alone. Whereupon I pray you (noble <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) eaſe my impatient minde of the burden of this deſire. I cannot my friend
<hi>Syrenus</hi> 
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:23115:127"/>(anſwered <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) but obey thee, wherein thou craueſt to be reſolued, ſince it is a thing appertaining to my office, to declare the rights and honors due to our Gods, and alſo a conuenient myſterie for you to know, and a thing eſpecially belonging to <hi>Pan</hi> the great God of Shepherds.</p>
               <p>As touching the firſt, you haue great cauſe to make no ſmall account of your functions and eſtates, when not onely <hi>Pan,</hi> but many other of our Gods haue vſed the like, beſides many great Emperours, Kings, &amp; worthie perſonages that haue not diſdained this ſimple and contented kinde of life, which was the firſt charge and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that our forefathers in the primitiue world embraced, whoſe names imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for you to know, and tedious for me to report, I meane to leaue vntold. So that you muſt not maruell if I told you that the firſt, to whom we offered ſacrifice, was this God. I know well, that I ſhould take my beginning by declaring what God this is: but bicauſe he hath none, I cannot put it in any other thing, but in himſelfe. For, to ſay that <hi>Pan,</hi> and <hi>Faunus</hi> is all one (as almoſt all authors auerre) I haue no reaſon to beleeue it, when by them themſelues I meane to refell it. For they ſay, that <hi>Faunus</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Picus,</hi> Father to
<hi>Latinus; Pan</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> God of the earth. To ſay alſo (as they affirme) that <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Syluanus</hi> is all one, it is falſe: for a certaine Autenticall author, after he had told that
<hi>Pan</hi> the God of Shepherds came, ſaid that <hi>Syluanus</hi> alſo came, with a root of a tree, into the which <hi>Cypariſus</hi> was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Whereupon it is cleerely gathered, that one cohereth but ill with the other. That which they hit neereſt of <hi>Syluanus,</hi> is, that he is the God of the dregs of the Elements, wherof all materiall things tooke their eſſence. Reuerend <hi>Pariſiles</hi> (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) you haue annulled that, which we tooke for a ſure ground, holding it euer for an infallible opinion, that all three were but one, or two of them at the leſt: Not onely you (ſaide <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) but almoſt all, who haue beene of greater reading and indgement. Indeede (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) to our ſexe and condition it is not graunted to vnderſtand ſo much, as to gainſay what you haue affirmed, and how much more (ſince you your ſelfe doe ſay it) ought it to be beleeued? But yet one doubt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to my minde about this matter: For noble <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> you ſaide, that
<hi>Pan</hi> had no beginning, and afterwardes confeſſed he was the ſonne of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> how can this be? It is wiſely obiected, anſwered
<hi>Pariſiles,</hi> and like one that notes my diſcourſe well. And in truth faire Shepherdeſſe, thou propoundeſt a queſtion to me, which I knowe not how with the honour of my Gods, or with mine owne to reſolue. For in ſooth I muſt faile in one, when I am conſtrained to confeſſe, that I vnderſtand it not, or that our Gods are none, if we muſt beleeue our writers: but bicauſe thou tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt me with contradiction in my ſpeech, I will haue thee knowe, that when I ſaide <hi>Pan</hi> had no beginning, it was but mine owne opinion, and true, if <hi>Pan</hi> ſignifies all. When I ſaid, he was the ſonne of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> it was according to their opinions that affirmed that <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Faunus</hi> were all one. And to bring contradiction in their opinions, was a thing ſufficient ynough to throwe them downe from their opinion, ſhewing their affections to be repugnant and contrarie. It remaines therefore for me to prooue, that he is not the ſonne of <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> both which I dare verifie with their owne grounds. For <hi>Pan</hi> is as much to ſay as all, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that he is God of all: They paint him as you knowe.
<hi>Demogorgon</hi> is as much to ſay as nature. Now then if <hi>Pan</hi> be God of all, and nature be ſomething, <hi>Pan</hi> is the God of nature; then by conſequence if <hi>Demogorgon</hi> be nature, <hi>Pan</hi> is God of
<hi>Demogorgon</hi> his father. If they will ſay that nature is not ſomething, but all, they muſt then be driuen to confeſſe that
<hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Demogorgon</hi> is all one, and not two things, which cannot be <pb n="249" facs="tcp:23115:127"/>two, ſince ech of them is abſolutely al. So that as our Authors confound themſelues with this God, they wil ſhew the like of all other Gods. But well (ſaide <hi>Syluanus</hi>) whom doe you beleeue that <hi>Pan</hi> is? Let him be whoſoeuer he will (anſwered
<hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiles</hi>) ſufficeth you to honor this God <hi>Pan</hi> vnder the name of the God of all. The firſt, that I knew did ſacrifice to this God was king <hi>Euander,</hi> and the firſt that built a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to him in
<hi>Arcadia</hi> at the foote of a hill called in the old time
<hi>Olympus,</hi> bicauſe <hi>Romulus</hi> (they ſaid) was nurſed in that place. This hill afterwards was called <hi>Palatine,</hi> and <hi>Lyceus,</hi> wherein were fower principall things. A <hi>Wood</hi> conſecrated to
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> of ſuch qualitie, that if any deſpiſing the lawe that forbad them to enter in, did go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, he died within one yeere after. An
<hi>Aulter</hi> in the top of it to the ſame <hi>Iupiter,</hi> held in great reuerence. A <hi>Fountaine</hi> of ſo maruellous a nature, that it ſeemed the Gods were more curious in it, then in any other thing; for the water being gently ſtirred with an oken twigge, a vapour roſe ſuddenly out of it like a thicke miſte: The which, not long after being congealed into a cloude, and mixed with others that were there raiſed vp, was ſufficient to haue made a great ſhower of raine. And at the foote of the hill laie a certaine place or ſpace of ground called <hi>Lupercall,</hi> which ſome ſaie tooke that name, bicauſe there were no woolues that ranged vp &amp; downe with their crueltie to hurt the harmeleſſe ſheepe. Others, bicauſe
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> were nurſed there by a certaine woman called <hi>Lupa.</hi> Heere therefore ſtoode the temple of God <hi>Pan,</hi> and heereupon the ſacrifices they do him, tooke their name
<hi>Lupercalles:</hi> They were firſt called <hi>Lycea</hi> of the hill, where firſt they were made, and are ſolemnized, as you know, the eighteene of Ianuarie. They that celebrated thoſe ſacrifices were called
<hi>Lupercos:</hi> who in making them, ran naked vp and downe the ſtreetes, couering their faces with maskes, and hauing in their handes certaine reines made of Goates skinnes, wherewith they ſmit the handes and bellies of women with childe, and of thoſe that coulde not conceiue, to make the childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth by theſe meanes more eaſie to them, and the others fruitfull. They went vppe and downe naked (as ſome ſay) to ſhewe thereby (as it ſeemed) the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their God: and bicauſe <hi>Pan</hi> (as others ſay) abhorred garments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they paint him without them. And becauſe
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> (as others report) being one daie with other yoongſters to celebrate theſe ſacrifices, and to exerciſe their perſons in games agreeable to their youth, wherein they caſt off their garments for heat, newes came that their flockes were ſtolne away: who with the reſt of the youth, full of rage and anger, not ſtaying to put on their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, purſued the theeues, and the victorie obtained by <hi>Remus</hi> with the <hi>Fabians,</hi> that were in his companie, they got their flockes againe. In honorable memorie of which valiant act, it was afterwards ordained, that they that offered ſacrifice to <hi>Pan,</hi> ſhould be naked. All which aboueſaide hath continued vntill our times, except the going naked: for it was not vſed ſince a certain Roman dictator refuſed th'imperial crown that a Conſull (made <hi>Lupercus</hi>) did put on his head: for that which that Conſull did, was ſo abhominable in the ſight of the people of Rome, that, for his ſake, they abhorred from thence ſuch an vnſeemely forme of ſacrifice. You ſee here therefore (my friends) how I haue reſolued you (I thinke) in that which you asked me, wherein though I haue ſeemed ſomewhat long, yet ſhorter, then ſo ample a matter as this required. And I thinke too breefe (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) conſidering how much you haue laide open vnto vs. Wherfore do vs yet this pleaſure (I pray you) to tell vs why God <hi>Pan</hi> ſo much abhorreth garments. With a good will, ſaid
<hi>Pariſiles,</hi> for it is both prettie and pleaſant.</p>

                  <hi>Hercules</hi> going on a day to recreate himſelfe with his loue <hi>Iole</hi> along the ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed woods and pleaſant groues, to eſchew the heate of the Sunne, <hi>Pan</hi> from a hill aloft beheld them, but eſpecially caſt an earneſt eie vpon <hi>Iole,</hi> a woman of a moſt ſweete and faire countenance. He ſaw her, and ſeeing burned in her loue, and ſaid. I haue not now, O yee deities of theſe mountaines, to do with you any more, nor to ſee you from this time forward. Farewell, farewell. For ſhe is onely my delight. <hi>Iole</hi> had her ſhoulders and breſt ſhining like golde with her yellow haire that from her head fell dangling downe vpon them. The ſunne now waxing pale, and ſhining but a little, began to giue as little heate, and the moiſt welkin with the euening dewe of approching night, came ſtealing on apace with her ſable coloured horſes, when <hi>Hercules</hi> with his company tooke vp a caue neere to the vineyards of <hi>Lidia:</hi> wherein, while ſupper was a preparing for the ſeruants, <hi>Iole</hi> for her pleaſure, or for ſome other merrie conceit that ſhe had in her head, did put her apparell vpon mightie <hi>Hercules,</hi> vnripping the ſeames to make it fitter for him, and tearing that which was too ſtreight. On her-ſelfe ſhe put the Lyons skin, and tooke his club on hir ſhoulder, and in her hands, her husbands bowe and arrowes. In this ſort they ſupped, and laid them downe to ſleepe, and with this habite each of them in a bed by themſelues (as time and place affoorded them) began to ſleepe: for it was not lawfull for them that night to lie togither, bicauſe the next day they were to offer vp ſacrifice to
<hi>Bacchus.</hi> And now (<hi>Pan</hi> burning in impatient loue) about midnight, which was very darke (for what doth not a louer enterprize) came into the caue, and found the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, what with their great cheere and wine at ſupper, and what with their ſports afterwards, faſt a ſleepe, thinking the ſame might be alſo the cauſe of their Maſter and Miſtreſſe ſleepe. His good fortune therefore falling out ſo well, conducted him to the place, where <hi>Iole</hi> was (happie man if he had knowne his good happe) where groping vp and down, and feeling the Lyons pawe, with feare he lifted vp his hand, (thinking it was <hi>Hercules</hi> that lay there) as the muſing traueller by the high way, his foote, that hath vnawares troden vpon ſome ſnake or hidden adder he ſawe not. Going therefore from thence he met by chance with the couch where <hi>Hercules</hi> in a habite different from his perſon, lay a ſleepe, whom when <hi>Pan</hi> touched, and ſelt
<hi>Ioles</hi> ſoft and delicate garments, thinking he had founde that he ſought for, at the beds feete began to mount vp, and lifting vp his clothes, in lieu of finding a ſoft and tender skin, felt a hard fleſh and full of haire. <hi>Hercules</hi> awaked out of his ſleepe, gaue the poore louer ſuch a blowe with his fiſt, that he ſmote him from the bed to the ground, where he laie all along. <hi>Iole</hi> awaked at the noiſe, and calling to her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants for light, found the ſillie God on the grounde complaining for the blowe he had receiued, which made not onely <hi>Hercules</hi> and his men, but his beloued <hi>Iole</hi> laugh apace at the infortunate louer. You therefore ſee heere (my friends) why the God deceiued by the garments, doth ſo much hate them. It is well (ſaide <hi>Syrenus.</hi>) But tell vs I beſeech you, as you haue begun, how we ſhould know him to bee the God of all by his picture. They paint him with two hornes, anſwered
<hi>Pariſiles,</hi> like to the ſunne beames, and to the hornes of the Moone, his face redde like a firie flame, in imitation of the firie Element. In his breſt a ſtar called <hi>Nebrides</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the ſtarres, which ſtarre I thinke was made of a wilde goates or Hearts skinne, bicauſe <hi>Nebrides</hi> is as much in ſignification as a wilde Goate or Heart: which skins they vſed in <hi>Bacchus</hi> ſacrifices: whereby we may eaſily gather, that he is God of all aboue. From the mids of his body downward, they paint him full of haire and briſtled, to ſignifie the trees and wilde beaſts; with Goates feete, <pb n="251" facs="tcp:23115:128"/>to ſhew the hardnes of the earth. And let this ſuffice for this time.</p>
               <p>With theſe and many other like curioſities, that the Shepherds demanded of <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> the night came on to his great contentment. The verie ſame day (as I ſaid) <hi>Felicia</hi> carried with her <hi>Stela:</hi> And Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena,</hi> and the Nymphes with
<hi>Crimine,</hi> went by themſelues to another place. To whom, after they were ſet vnder the ſhadow of ſome thick Sallowes, Lord <hi>Felix</hi> ſaid. So may all thy fortunes ſucceed happily to thee (faire Nymph) and according to thine owne deſire by ſeeing thy ſelfe in the greateſt proſperitie in the world, as thou wilt deigne to tell vs why <hi>Stela</hi> and thy ſelfe go wandring vp and downe ſo ſorrowfull in the company of this faire yoong Shepherd, and how long ſince it is you had acquaintance with him. Thou commandeſt me Lord <hi>Felix</hi> (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) to renew the ſumme of my ſorrowes and extremeſt grieſe. Alas, who can ſtop my teares from their continuall flowing by awaking ſuch tormenting memories? Who can quench my ſcalding ſighes, that with ſuch a heauie recitall will come ſmoking out of my balefull breaſt? How can I tell you my exceſſiue misfortunes in order, ſince there was neuer any in my innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſions? Let it content you Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> and you faire Ladies to knowe that you haue before your eies the moſt hapleſſe woman of all our ſexe, and in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the verie ſumme and pattern of all diſaſtrous virgins. Hauing thus ſpoken, a profound ſigh accompanied with abundant teares, hindered the reſt of her dolefull words: whereupon they came all together to comfort her, <hi>Feliſmena</hi> ſaying. Beleeue me (faire Nymphe) my Lord Don <hi>Felix</hi> woulde neuer haue requeſted this at thy hands, if he had thought to haue giuen thee the leaſt griefe in the world, but that he and all we were deſirous (by knowing the cauſe of thy ſorrowfull life) to helpe thee as much as we could in thy cares and troubles. O happie Ladie (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) how much art thou deceiued and the reſt, that thinke there is any remedie for my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps. But for the loue and friendſhip you ſhew me, and for that which I beare to you all, giue attentiue eare vnto my words, and vnderſtand my misfortunes; for I will ſatisfie you in that which Lord <hi>Felix</hi> hath demaunded of me. And becauſe you may knowe how far my miſhaps haue extended, and to what end my miſeries haue driuen me:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Know</hi> that I am forced to loue one, that hath no power to loue me againe; &amp; that it is not in my power, not to account her my deereſt friend, that entreats me like a cruell foe: Which thing becauſe it may perhaps ſeeme hard to you to beleeue, you muſt vnderſtand that I loue this Shepherd, that is our guide in our trauels, as much as I can, &amp; can in truth as much as I wil. I loue alſo <hi>Parthenius</hi> his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as much as I will, &amp; will truely as much as I can: for, as it cannot be diſcerned which is <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> and which <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and the one impoſſible to be knowen from the other, for like two drops of water they reſemble one another ſo much; ſo cannot I tell, which of them I loue moſt, louing both in equall balance of extreme affection. I thought once to be content and happie by being beloued of one of them, whereof when I was perſwaded, I was not yet ſatisfied. I cannot with reaſon complaine of them, ſince both, or at the leaſt <hi>Delicius</hi> (I think, nay firmly beleeue that my ſuſpition is not in vaine) hath forced himſelf as much as may be to loue me, by working al the means he could, which neuer yet lay in his power to do. Wherby you ſee that I haue placed my loue on him, that cannot (though faine he would) requite it with his againe. But you will aske me perhaps in whom the cauſe &amp; impediment conſiſteth, that they are not anſwerable to that, which both are ſo iuſtly owing me. To this I anſwere my greateſt and deereſt friend I haue in this worlde, bicauſe for hir, both are alike woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="252" facs="tcp:23115:129"/>with <hi>Cupids</hi> inuincible flight, ſhe dying no leſſe in both their loues. And who this is, you may eaſily geſſe, for ſhe can be no other then <hi>Stela.</hi> And yet I ſweare to you by all that a true louer can proteſt, that I neuer wiſhed <hi>Stela</hi> any ill, though ſhe is now, and hath euer beene the cauſe why I am not beloued of theſe two peereleſſe Shepherds. For I could for mine owne part do no more in her cauſe then ſhe doth in mine: and though I hated her beſides, yet it ſtoode me in hand to be her friend, when by her meanes I enioyed <hi>Delicius</hi> ſight, &amp; hope by the ſame to ſee <hi>Parthenius.</hi> But bicauſe you may know how we loſt our liberties, and they remained without theirs, I will onely tell you that, which maketh for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame day (as they afterwards tolde vs) that <hi>Stela</hi> by the ordinance of the Gods came to our company (for now you know that I am one of the Nymphes of the renowned and famous riuer <hi>Duerus</hi>)
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> and <hi>Delicius</hi> did ſee <hi>Stela,</hi> and both of them equally loued her, though then it ſeemed not ſo; for
<hi>Parthenius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his affection, bicauſe <hi>Delicius</hi> had manifeſted his before: But when <hi>Delicius</hi> tolde, that he was enamoured of <hi>Stela,</hi> they agreed to ſtay in a forreſt hard by, to ſee if ſomtimes comming out of the riuer they might haue ſome occaſion to talke with her. But when ſhe came out, and they offred to come towards vs that went in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of her, we fled away, and ran back againe to our riuer. Who perceiuing it was not poſſible to talke to her in that ſort, concluded to deceiue vs by wearing Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds weeds, and leauing of their courtly apparell. Thus therefore attending dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for vs, <hi>Stela</hi> and I came foorth, and as they ſaw vs (though they made no ſhewe thereof) one of them plaied aloud on his Baggepipe, to inuite vs (I thinke) vnto their muſicke: which when we heard, as it was a thing not vſed there manie daies before, we came ſomewhat neere, and hid our ſelues behinde a companie of thicke Sallowes. But they, who by ſtealth were looking on vs, perceiuing their deuiſe to haue a good beginning, made as though they had not ſeene vs, and betweene themſelues praied one another to play or ſing ſome ſong. In the end <hi>Parthenius</hi> getting the vpper hand,
<hi>Delicius</hi> tooke his Rebecke, whereon he ſo ſweetely played and ſung to it, that we thought <hi>Apollo</hi> had committed ſome newe fault to become a Shepherd againe, and that it was euen he that made that ſweete melodie. The ſong was of great ſentence, the inuention wittie, and the forme of it curious, wherefore lend an attentiue care to the one and the other, if you deſire to delight you with it.</p>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:23115:130"/>Now as <hi>Delicius</hi> had ended his ſong, and <hi>Stela</hi> thinking that he had made an end indeede of ſinging and playing (although it was not ſo, for <hi>Delicius</hi> was reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting <hi>Parthenius</hi> to play on his Rebecke and to ſing) ſhe ſaide vnto me. Tell me faire <hi>Crimine,</hi> Enioyeth this ſolitarie place oftentimes ſuch like voices, ioyned with ſuch heauenly ſweetenes? If it be ſo, I cannot but in ſome ſort complaine of the amitie lately commenced, and confirmed betweene vs, in that I haue not ſpent the time in ſuch pleaſure and delight, as now by the ſweetenes of this muſicke and fine ſong we haue amply had. After that cruell <hi>Gorphoroſt</hi> (my deere friend ſaide I) whom the Gods confound for bereauing vs of a great part of our pleaſures, began to dwell in theſe partes, this is the firſt Bagpipe and Rebecke, that in this forreſt hath beene long ſince touched, of ſo many Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes, that haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally plaied and ſung in other times before when they fed their ſheepe heere, and paſſed away the heate of the day vnder theſe greene trees: whereupon I maruell no leſſe at the noueltie of this accident, then at the rare melodie of the ſong, for I neuer heard the like ſince I firſt dwelt in this place, nor that euer delighted my ſenſes ſo much. But bicauſe they begin to play and ſing againe, let vs goe a little to them, for they ſeeme to be milde and courteous youthes, and ſuch that make a ſhew to haue ſome reſpect and reuerence of vs that be Nymphes. When I had ſpoken this, we went towards them, who perceiuing it, felt an extreme ioy, bicauſe they had now brought their deſired purpoſe to effect. But to diſſemble the more with vs, and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we might not take vs to our woonted flight, they ſat ſtill, without once riſing to doe vs any courteſie, vntill we firſt ſpake vnto them. When we were come vnto them, and ſawe two ſuch goodly yoong Shepherdes, and ſo like in face and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, turning to <hi>Stela,</hi> I ſaide. Behold what two faire Shepherdes, but ſeeſt thou not how like they be? There is not in my iudgement, ſiluer to ſiluer, gold to gold, nor water to water ſo like as theſe be. Our <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Amphitrion</hi> could not be ſo much one, nor <hi>Mercurie</hi> ſo like to
<hi>Soſia,</hi> when to enioy <hi>Alomenas</hi> loue, <hi>Iupiter</hi> in the likenes of <hi>Amphitrion</hi> kept him out of his owne houſe; and
<hi>Mercurie</hi> in the likenes of <hi>Soſia</hi> made his man feele the hardnes of his fiſt. Then turning by and by to the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, I ſpake thus vnto them. Your vnaccuſtomed and ſweete ſongs (gracious Shepherds) after the long ſuſpence and ſilence of many, that haue beene long ſince made in theſe fieldes, haue forced vs to come thus abruptly to enioy the ſweetenes of them; if we therefore (being Nymphes) are of any eſtimation with you iolly Shepherdes, we beſeech you, that our preſence be not of woorſe condition and entertainment then theſe trees, which (without moouing) were euen now harkening vnto you, nor may diſpleaſe you no more then our abſence, and to make no more difficultie to ſing, now we are heere, then when we were not. At theſe wordes the Shepherdes riſing vp, and asking one another who ſhould anſwere, <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſaid. Sweete Nymphes in grace and beautie non pareille, we will not deny but that, in reſpect of your courteous ſpeech to vs, we are bounde to performe your gracious requeſt (at will they caſt out golden wordes which ſauoured of the glozings in the Court) and confeſſe no leſſe, that we are conſtrained to obey you more for your owne ſakes, then for any thing elſe, be it ſpoken with pardon of the reſt of theſe goodly Nymphes: So that onely tell vs wherein wee may giue you content, and we will doe our beſt to pleaſe your mindes. Our mindes ſaide I, you haue already vnderſtood. Then ſince it is ſo, ſaide <hi>Delicius,</hi> begin <hi>Parthenius</hi> to ſing. It were better, ſaid <hi>Partthenius,</hi> for thee to do it: for in regard of the great ſweetnes wherwith (not without good cauſe) thou haſt alreadie delighted them, thy <pb n="255" facs="tcp:23115:130"/>ſelfe being alſo more skilfull in muſicke, whatſoeuer I ſhall ſing after thee to my diſgrace, will be but yrkſome, and vnpleaſant to their eares. Thou haſt no reaſon to ſay ſo, ſaid <hi>Delicius,</hi> for thy verſes will giue teſtimonie of the truth of thy ſide. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Parthenius</hi> would haue begun, but not finding himſelfe ſatisfied, bicauſe I onely entreated him, and not <hi>Stela,</hi> he ſaid vnto me. I would not (gracious Nymphe) by obeying thy requeſt to content thee, giue any occaſion of diſlike to thy companion, which mooues me to ſpeake it, bicauſe I know not whether it be her will that I ſhould ſing or no? There is not any thing (anſwered
<hi>Stela</hi>) that likes this faire Nymph, which doth not alſo pleaſe me, how much the more (if it were not ſo) for hir owne ſake ſhould it ſuffice thee to fulfill her minde, without making any matter of my liking at all. Both of them would faine haue anſwered to theſe words, but that (I thinke) they were afraid, one of them becauſe he would not ſhew himſelfe on the ſudden ſo appaſſionate; the other, not to diſpleaſe or make me bluſh, a thing that made much for their purpoſe; and alſo becauſe I now tooke them by the hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Stela.</hi> The Shepherd hath ſpoken verie well, and hath great reaſon, entreat him therefore to ſing, for he lookes for it. Bicauſe then we will not delay the matter any longer (ſaid <hi>Stela</hi>) leauing that aſide which might be ſaid heerein, I requeſt him with this warning, that if another time thou entreateſt him to do any thing, and if he will not do it, that he aske not counſell of me, ſince by fulfilling thy will he ſhall ſatisfie mine. We will obſerue this charge (ſaid <hi>Delicius:</hi>) and ſee thou forgetteſt it not
<hi>Parthenius.</hi> Then the one began to touch his Rebecke, the other to play on his Bagpipe: And going about to begin his ſong, <hi>Parthenius</hi> was a pretie while in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, not knowing what matter to take in hand, for he would haue ſaide ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Stelas</hi> beautie, for whom he felt no leſſe ſecret paine, then <hi>Delicius</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke paſſion: But the force of friendſhip on the other ſide diuerted him from it. And ſo partly for ioy to do that which touched the loue of his friend <hi>Delicius,</hi> and with griefe to go againſt that, whereunto he was bound for himſelfe, he would by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Delicius</hi> perſwade <hi>Stela</hi> to incline to his owne loue, whoſe beginning was this, entring after the ſelfe ſame ſort as his friend did in the ſong before.</p>

But yet we could not attaine to the cauſe of his greef, wherof (though earneſtly we craued it on him) he told no more, then by fained apparances (far from the truth indeed) we were able to coniecture: To whom therefore with a modeſt ſmile I ſaid, I would not be of thyqualitie (gracious Shepherd) to praiſe thee in thine owne preſence, as thou haſt done thy friend, although he excels thee not (perhaps) in any thing, ſince in ſweete voice and good grace thou art as like him, as in faire ſhape and figure. But for all this <hi>Delicius</hi> is beholding to thee (for ſo me thinkes thou calleſt him) but <hi>Bicauſe the praiſe in ones preſence is held for no leſſe then a gloze,</hi> I woulde counſell thee to reſerue it to ſome other time, when he is out of thy ſight and hearing. Thou muſt not condemne me (gracious Nymph anſwered <hi>Parthenius</hi>) without hearing firſt what I can ſay, for it may be thou wilt iudge it (though thy accuſation ſeeme iuſt to thee) cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, when by good reaſon I ſhall reſolue thee heerein, premiſing that this rule is not ſo vniuerfall, <hi>That none must not be praiſed in preſence,</hi> but that neceſſitie may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes infringe it: whereby not onely one may praiſe another in his preſence, but that he may do the ſame by himſelfe, for his owne behoofe. What neceſſitie is requiſite for that ſaid <hi>Stela?</hi> To this when <hi>Parthenius</hi> held his peace, turning to <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> ſhe ſaide vnto him; If thy friend will not anſwer, tell thou vs what it is. <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> although he knew it, not preſuming yet to tell it, ſaide: I ſaie nothing, but that in my vſurped name he ſings of his owne praiſes and deſerts. <hi>Parthenius</hi> going about to replie to this, I ſtept in betweene and ſaide. Let there bee no more time ſpent in curteſies; but tell vs, if it pleaſe you, from whence you are, (for your habites denie you to be of any place heereabouts) and whither your way lies, and eſpecially if you meane to ſtay any long time in this countrie? And bicauſe we know alreadie one of your names, to oblige you the more to make vs know the others, know that I am called <hi>Crimine,</hi> and my friend and companion heere <hi>Stela. Delicius</hi> then taking her by the hand anſwered. Our incertaine &amp; doubtfull pilgrimage is to ſeeke out our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, with certaine tokens that we carrie with vs to know them (for being children they left vs yoong, as yet neuer knowing how they are called, or from whence they are) which are no other but to ſeeke out a faire yoong Shepherd, and a graue olde woman, both which at one time, but in different places, gaue vs to certaine nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to be brought vp. The name of my companion and friend is <hi>Parthenius;</hi> Mine, as thou ſaieſt by my friends ſong. Our tarrying heere ſhall be no longer then it ſhall pleaſe both you. If it be referred to our pleaſure ſaid <hi>Stela,</hi> take vs not for ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ones, that we know not how to profit our ſelues by enioying ſo good conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo ſweete and vnwoonted muſicke. Yet woulde we not be ſo ill aduiſed to preferre our pleaſure before your due pietie, nor without content to hinder your
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23115:132"/>good intent. The moſt religious intent, ſweete and faireſt <hi>Stela</hi> (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) and that which toucheth our ſoules neereſt, is thy gracious command to haue vs ſtaie ſtill in this countrey, bicauſe we may not leeſe ſo pleaſant howers as theſe be. I will not hinder ſo commendable a purpoſe (ſaid <hi>Stela</hi>) although I would be glad, if (now returned, and your fathers found) it liked you to liue ſtil heere in theſe parts, to ſpend thoſe few howers, that we vſe to come abroad, in honeſt &amp; ſeemly recreation. Then I calling that to minde which <hi>Parthenius</hi> had ſung, That <hi>Delicius</hi> on a pride and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie had deſpiſed all women for onely one, whom hee loued more then himſelfe, with ſmiling I anſwered. And now Shepherd I will command thee to ſtaie, at the leaſt to ſee if I muſt alſo be put in the number of diſdained women, or if I am onely beloued of thee. With theſe and ſuch like ſpeeches we paſſed away the heate of the day, with this agreement in the end, that they ſhould ſtay a certain time therabouts, to inquire out ſome newes of their vnknowne parents in thoſe parts, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to paſſe away the heate of the day in that ſame place, where we would not faile to keepe them companie. Which being agreed on, <hi>Stela</hi> ſaid vnto me; Let vs now go, if thou thinkeſt good, my friend
<hi>Crimine,</hi> for it is a pretie while ſince we came foorth, bicauſe we will not giue our keeper an occaſion to blame vs for our long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. But bicauſe you may better vnderſtand this, which <hi>Stela</hi> ſaid, you muſt know, that by all meanes poſſible we procured to giue <hi>Stela</hi> all the content and pleaſure we could, for which cauſe we did let her go with company to diſport her-ſelfe vp and downe in that greene forreſt. But being afraide of fierce <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> one of vs euer remained at the riuers ſide vnder a palme tree, that ſtoode almoſt right ouer againſt that part, where there was but one paſſage, to the end, that if the vgly Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd had come downe, ſhe might haue warned vs by ſounding of a cornet, to hie vs home againe with <hi>Stela.</hi> Taking our leaues therefore of the Shepherds (no doubt without ſome inward ſighes of theirs) we returned to our dwelling places, and they ſtaied ſtill in the forreſt. The next day going very ſoftly about the ſame hower, and by ſecret places to ſee how they were occupied, we founde them ſitting vpon the greene graſſe, and Sleeping in ſuch ſort, that they ſhewed, that that was not their principall intent; for the chriſtalline teares, that trickled downe their burning cheekes in corriualitie, ſignified more ſtore of ſorrowfull thoughts in their harts, then heauy vapours in their heads. The face of the one was right againſt the others, as though they had beene talking togither, leaning their cheekes vpon the one hand, and with the other arme ſuſtaining the waight of the arme and head, in which ſort they lay caſting out ſomtimes profound &amp; greeuous ſighs. Which thing moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs to no ſmall compaſſion, for nowe we were ſomewhat affected to them, we determined to withdraw our ſelues, leaſt being awaked, they might (perhaps) haue had an occaſion to be aſhamed to be ſeene in that ſort: And from thence a little way off, of purpoſe to awake them, but as though we had ſeene nothing, we began to ſing, taking for the ground and ſubiect of our ſong, the teares, that they had ſhed before vs. That which we ſung was this.</p>

               <p>As their ſleepe was nothing elſe but an extaſie, ſcarce had we begun, when they awooke, and ſeeing that we left ſinging when we came neere them, they ſaide. If your comming were an occaſion to make an ende of your ſinging, we would be glad that you had ſtayed a little longer; wherefore let not our preſence be of worſe condition to depriue vs of this delight, then our abſence was by enioying it, and ſince we refuſed not to do what you commanded vs, nor made it ſtrange to acquaint you with the baſenes of our ſimple Bagpipes, diſdaine not then (faire Nymphes) by that which we entreat you, to ſhew vs the highnes of your excellent voices. Well well the truth of this is knowen (ſaid we againe) but not denying your demaunds, ſince we haue time for it, tell vs now if you meane to reſt you here a fewe daies. Reſt (faire Nymphes) anſwered <hi>Delicius?</hi> Why, we know not what it is, if we had it here. But we are determined to haue it as long as it ſhall pleaſe your good wils; which are ready to do you all the pleaſure we may, ſaid I, but I will tell you one thing, which it may be ye neuer yet heard. By the report and certaine newes of the fertilitie of this Countrey, there are tenne or twelue yeeres paſt, ſince from the North parts there departed a mightie huge Shepherd with a great number of ſheepe, and came to feed in theſe grounds (certes not ſo faire and amiable a perſonage as either of you) the Sonne of God <hi>Syluanus</hi> he ſaith, and of a moſt ſtrong and fierce Shepherdeſſe, that came with him, whether fayrer and more gracious then my companion here, I am not able to tell you. This vnſeemely Shepherd was not onely like to his parents in face and fierceneſſe, but in either of both, as alſo in hideous feature he hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of them. Seeing therefore that fame was no lyer, and how the ſituation of that part of the riuer (being no leſſe then a great I land) inuited him for his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without feare of the wilde beaſtes, which made it deſert and inhabitable, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to liue there: Which I land, as it will in time I hope be cleane eaten out by the riuer (for by little and little it is euerie day made leſſe) ſo I wiſh it had now the full and complete time with the forcible waters to be quite conſumed. The name of this monſtrous man is <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> whoſe incredible ſtrength and bignes, becauſe you may vnderſtand, behold the depth of this riuer, and the maine force wherewith it runs, with wading ouer himſelfe a foote, by three and three, and fower and fower he ſets ouer all his ſheepe on the other ſide: which haue multiplied in ſuch numbers (for ſince his comming he hath almoſt killed all the wilde beaſts that might deſtroy them) that there is ſcarce any place to containe them: and ſo, not able to put a great part of them vnder the ſhades, he lets them goe freely amids the fields and along the riuer bankes, without feare of eſtraying or any other danger, being inuironed by the waters that keepe them in manner of a priſon. We wiſhed well to <hi>Gorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rost,</hi> and would haue pleaſured him for killing the wilde beaſts, that annoyed not a little this pleaſant countrey wherefoeuer they went, if there with all not iniuring the Shepherds of theſe places, he had not depriued vs of their friendly company, though to our ſelues, but onely in theſe reſpects he did neuer any other harme, who are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound vnto him (though of his own vertue it proceeds not the not offending of vs) that he hath bin a meanes, whereby this faire Nymphe is in our companie. The
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:23115:133"/>end therefore, for the which I haue made this ſhort admonition, is, that we would not haue you for our ſakes ſuffer any harme by this rude Shepherd, who for all this hath forgotten a great part of his fierceneſſe, ſince he gaue place and entrance to gentle loue. Wherupon you may know how great the force of that mightie child is. But if in theſe daies (for I am certaine he will not come out for a ſolemne oath he made) ſome good meanes may be found to make you liue heere with ſafetie, we will not be a little carefull to ſeeke it out for you: And if there bee none, yet ſhall it pleaſe vs better, that with your abſence you ſhould be free from daunger, then with your preſence (for our content) to hazard your liues, or ſafetie anie waie. They thanked vs for our good will, and ſeemed not to take care for anie thing, that might happen, in lieu, that wee fayled not of our agreement with them; <hi>Parthenius</hi> aſſuring vs, that he could ſo well flatter, and pleaſe fierce <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> that they might without any harme abide there ſtill. With theſe words and ſome amorous ſongs that we fower did ſing in courſe, we paſſed away the heate of that day, and returned (as we were woont) to the riuer, they remaining ſtill in that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant forreſt, which ſerued them for their dwelling place, and making prouiſion of neceſſarie foode for their ſuſtenance from the villages thereabouts. Not onely <hi>Delicius, Parthenius, Stela</hi> and I failed not in thoſe firſt eight daies to be at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place of our meeting, but the fame of the new Shepherds came to the eares of ſome other Nymphes, who comming thither, and conſorting with vs, made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious and pleaſant quiers, dances, and ſongs to the tune of their Rebeckes and Baggepipes; ſomtimes lending a gentle eare to <hi>Parthenius</hi> and
<hi>Delicius</hi> ſweete ſongs; ſomtimes applying our ſelues to telling of tales: At which pleaſant meetings old <hi>Pariſies,</hi> who ſometimes came to ſee his daughter, gaue no ſmall content to euery one with his wiſe precepts and counſell touching the honour of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Gods, and ſhewing their diuine prouidence in all creatures, and by them the great power and might of their eternall creator, by explaining the accelerate cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and motions of the celeſtiall globes, and the cauſe of their vnwearied ſwiftnes. In which time <hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> gained ſo greatly to their wils, the loue of all my companions, Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes, (who alſo reſorted thither) kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> had vowed, that they were not meanely beloued of all, as well for their ſweete ſongs and playing, as alſo for their wiſedome, demeanour, and good graces. But aboue all faire <hi>Stela</hi> and I without compariſon exceeded them, though my loue with <hi>Parthenius</hi> was more openly extended, wherunto I had then moſt of al diſpoſed my minde; and for no other cauſe, then that I knew <hi>Delicius</hi> had emploied his thoughts and loue on <hi>Stela;</hi> and alſo bicauſe Ithought
<hi>Parthenius</hi> was moſt free. Betweene vs both, like rude girles, we knew not how to gouerne our ſelues in <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> affaires. Betweene vs both, being but a littleprudent, we were ignorant howe we ſhould behaue vs in the effects of this childe, and therefore endured him impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, though harder and more violent he was to <hi>Stela</hi> then to me, not bicauſe I had beene a longer ſcholler in <hi>Venus</hi> ſchoole, or had more experience in her blinde Sonnes effects then ſhe; but bicauſe ſhe deſired, and forced her-ſelfe to wring out the worme out of her hart, that euery day without feeling it, crept more and more into the center of it; for of ſuch qualitie is this traytour loue, that the more one endeuors to ſhake him off, with greater force he takes place and ſeiſeth on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſoule: So that <hi>Stela</hi> the more ſhe laboured not to loue the Shepherds, the more couragiouſly loue aſſailed hir, which made her night nor day take any reſt, nor finde eaſe in any thing: all which I afterwards knew by her owne mouth, who at the <pb n="261" facs="tcp:23115:133"/>firſt diſſembled the matter ſo cunningly, that I could gather nothing of it. And ſo, meaning to take away the effect by remoouing the cauſe, ſhe would ſometimes ſlie from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, refraining to com where the Shepherds were ſtaying for vs, vnles ſhe was importuned by me. But after certain daies that we foure were al alone togither, I ſaid. It is not reaſon yong Shepherdes, that with thereſt we liue in doubt of kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing you, but that in ſome point we may perceiue a difference betweene you, when as oftentimes we cannot, no more then the reſt, call you by your right names, which I aſſure you troubles vs not a little: So that I would faine haue one of you take ſome kinde of marke to be knowen from the other, but in ſuch ſecret ſort, to put vs out of doubt, and make the reſt remaine ſtill therein: Our intent anſwered
<hi>Delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> hath beene hitherto (gracious <hi>Crimine</hi>) to haue our garments make no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude betweene them, whom one will and ſhape hath made ſo like. But to pleaſure thee herein, &amp; that by taking it, no offence be miniſtred to thy companion, let faire <hi>Stela</hi> ſet downe the difference betweene vs in outward ſhew, ſince ſhe hath made it in the inward ſoule. I know not Shepherd ſaid <hi>Stela,</hi> what difference I haue put betweene you and <hi>Parthenius.</hi> Thy conceit faire <hi>Stela</hi> is not I thinke ſo hard, as thy hart, but that thou maiſt eaſily coniecture, how much loue workes in me for thy ſake. The puteneſie of my thoughts (ſaide <hi>Stela</hi>) hath made me ignorant of that, which I would had not beene. The hardnes of thy hart (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) hath made me prudent in that, which was not ſo much expedient for me. Doſt thou then ſpeak it in good earneſt ſaide <hi>Stela,</hi> That thou loueſt me? Doſt thou then aske it in ieſt (ſaid <hi>Delicius</hi>) if I loue thee? No ſaid <hi>Stela:</hi> But then belike I am ſhe (as the matter fals out) to whom thou haſt adreſſed all thy ſongs and teares. <hi>Delicius</hi> thinking to haue a proſperous gale (whereof we alſo thought him aſſured, for all this while ſhe ſeemed not to be angrie, but milde and gentle, whereby ſhe got that out of his hart (which the forrowfull ſoule had kept ſo ſecret in his breaſt) with a pitifull eie caſt on her, anſwered. Euen ſhe indeed thou art, as the matter fals out, to whom I auow the terme and ſeruice of my life and voluntarie ſubiection of my ſoule, that is, &amp;c. Enough, enough ſaid <hi>Stela.</hi> I vnderſtand thee too well, and am now reſolued of my former ſuſpitions. I neuer thought that the bold preſumption of a miſerable and obſcure man could ſo far extend as to entertaine a thought ſo preiudiciall to my honor. Wherefore from this day let come who will to enioy thy poiſoned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. When ſhe had ſpoken theſe bitter wordes, with an auſtere and angrie countenance, ſhe flung from thence without any companie, and with no leſſe haſte, then the timorous virgin, that walking by ſome hedge, and treading with her fine foote vpon ſome careleſſe viper, appalled with feate, flieth with ſpeede away: The tender harted <hi>Delicius</hi> not able to powre foorth any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, as one ſtroken dumbe, remained no leſſe aſtoniſhed then the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herde, ſeeing the faithfull Maſtie harde by his ſide ſtroken dead with a fearefull thunderclap, and the graſſe but euen now greene at his ſeete, burned by the ſudden lightning thereof. On whom I tooke ſo great compaſſion, that I could not ſtaie my teares, but turning my face to <hi>Farthenius</hi> to bid him helpe his fellow, I eſpied him in a ſenceleſſe trance, repreſenting more the image of a dead bodie, then the ſigure of a liue man, to whom it was no leſſe then death to ſee his deere friend in ſuch a plight, and woorſe then death to his decaied ſoule, knowing that he muſt nowe be depriued of the ſight of his deere
<hi>Stela,</hi> the onely reward and comfort of all his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate paſſions. Seing my <hi>Parthenius</hi> in ſuch a caſe, like a true louer I claſped my hands togither, and then opening them againe, ſaide. O diſmall day! At which very <pb n="262" facs="tcp:23115:134"/>inſtant I caſt my ſelfe vpon
<hi>Parthenius</hi> (for when <hi>Stela</hi> was riſen vp to be gone, I alſo roſe vp from my place) &amp; ioyning his pale face to mine, kiſſed him ſoftly; he (poore <hi>Parthenius</hi>) hanging downe his head in my lappe. At the voice that I gaue, <hi>Delicius</hi> (awaked as it were out of a deepe ſleepe) ſighed; and ſeeing <hi>Parthenius</hi> in like caſe, fell againe into another ſwoune, and remained in ſuch ſort as my
<hi>Parthenius</hi> did. I was a good while embracing my <hi>Parthenius</hi> (for loue and pitie ouercame my due regarde of modeſtie) and held him in ſuch ſort as you haue heard, not taking away my face from his, but at the end crauing helpe of <hi>Delictus,</hi> I perceiued he ſtood in no leſſe neede of the ſame. Beleeue me (Gentlemen) if my paine might haue beene aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, I muſt needs haue felt it by this ſecond ſight of
<hi>Delictus:</hi> But my griefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreme, and nothing able to adde more torments to my tortured ſoule, I felt them not, vnleſſe it were to ſee my ſelfe all alone in ſuch a caſe. But animared by the deſire I had to helpe them, I tooke a fine aſhen diſh out of one of their ſcrips, and ranne to the riuer for ſome water, and hauing brought it, beſprinkled both their faces with it: who being therewith, and with ſhaking them, a little awaked, with a merier countenance then courage, I ſaid vnto them. What faintnes of hart is this yoong Shepherds? Yee are but yoong Apprentiſes (it ſeemes) in <hi>Cupids</hi> ſeruice, ſince you will giue him ouer at the firſt encounter by leauing your liues in his hands. But faine would I know
<hi>Parthenius</hi> (for then I imagined nothing of his ſecret loue) what made thee ſo much beſides thy ſelfe (for the cauſe of <hi>Delicius</hi> his griefe, and of his ſudden traunce I know well enough.) What, did
<hi>Stelas</hi> ſharpe anſwere touch thee ſo neere? No, anſwered
<hi>Parthenius.</hi> What was it then, ſaid I againe? <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who would not for all the world haue manifeſted the loue he bare to
<hi>Stela,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: bicauſe I ſaw my deere <hi>Delicius</hi> in ſome danger, whoſe chiefeſt deſires and their full accompliſhment I rather wiſh with greater content, and in higher degree then mine owne. It greeued me not (Gentlemen) to heare him ſpeake this, for now had the impatient worme of iealouſie begun to gnaw my throbbing hart. I beleeue thee ſaid <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> but knoweſt thou what I thinke of all theſe matters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions that thou haſt tolde, That thou wert the onely gayner, ſince thou enioyedſt ſo pleaſant (though ſo ſmall a time) being in ſuch ſort as thou wert with <hi>Parthenius.</hi> By our virgin rights I ſweare to thee (ſaide <hi>Crimine</hi>) that I would rather haue beene depriued of that delightfull being with my <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ſo that I had beene excuſed of the great greefe I had to ſee him in ſo pitifull a caſe. For if thou haſt not tried faire Ladie, yet happily thou maiſt haue heard ſay, That a pleaſure or delight is but halfe taſted which is diſtempered by one bitter greefe or ſorrow. But leauing this aſide, will you knowe (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) whereupon I haue thought? Whereon ſaid <hi>Crimine?</hi> On this (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) muſing with my ſelfe, how thou couldeſt call the Shepherdes by their owne names, whereas thou ſaiedſt, they could not be knowen one from another for their great likenes, which cauſed thee to requeſt ſome priuie tokens to diſcerne them, which hitherto yet thou haſt not told vs. So that I conceiue not how without knowing them diſtinctly (as if the difference were now made) thou ſhouldſt name them ſo right, giuing to each his proper name. Thou ſaieſt well faire Lady (ſaid <hi>Crimine.</hi>) But that which is already told, may ſatisfie thy demaund. For <hi>Delicius</hi> alone was the man (I ſaid) that loued (at the leſt openly) without telling whom, vntill this laſt accident befell, which we by his ſpeeches, and ſo ſoone as he had but opened his mouth eaſily gathered, ſo that although we knew not them, when we came to them, yet by the manner of their talke we were afterwardes cleered of that doubt. It is well (ſaid <hi>Doria</hi>) And as thou
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:23115:134"/>loueſt thy ſelfe faire <hi>Crimine,</hi> proceede in this hiſtorie of your loue and fortune, for I am partaker of ſome of the paine, wherein thou lefteſt the ſolitarie and ſorrowfull Shepherdes. To comfort them in their great greefe, ſaide <hi>Crimine,</hi> I reaſoned with them with ſome apparant and conſolatorie wordes, but the afflicted Shepherdes ceaſed not to powre out abundance of teares, with no ſmall quantitie of burning ſighes: whereupon blaming them ſometimes, and ſometimes incouraging them, I endeuoured to cheere them vp, but all was not ynough to disburden them of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire in that ſorrowfull place, if I had not armed them with an apparant hope to reſtore <hi>Delicius</hi> to
<hi>Stelas</hi> fauour againe, by enioying it more then euer he had before, though he would not haue meanely contented him with that alone, whereof he was depriued without requeſting any more. But thinking it was now, more then conuenient time to goe my waies, I tooke my leaue of the Shepherdes, promiſing them to doe what poſſibly I could in their affaires, in the which I onely commended patience vnto them for a few daies, telling them that a hard impoſtume in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning could not be cured, vntill by time, and plaiſters laide thereunto, it be firſt mollified and made tender; and that in the meane while I would not with other Nymphes forget to viſit them, though not ſo often as I deſired, not to leaue <hi>Stela</hi> all alone, as alſo for auoiding of ſuſpicion. In this ſpace of time bicauſe
<hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> did leade ſo ſad and vncomfortable a life, which by no kinde of paſtime could be cheered, and alſo bicauſe the vowed time of <hi>Gorphorosts</hi> comming abroade was neere at hand, all our company was diſſolued. <hi>Parthenius,</hi> who was not onely carefull for that which touched him, but eſpecially for that which was needefull for his friend, went ſometimes walking vp and downe along the riuer bankes, and by ſinging many amorous and ſorrowfull ſonnets, practiſed to enter into familiaritie &amp; friendſhip with fierce
<hi>Gorphorost,</hi> bicauſe they might by theſe meanes (whileſt hee kept him companie, and tolde him many things to pleaſe his louing humour) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger continue ſtill in that forreſt; and alſo, bicauſe holding him other times with tales and diſcourſes, <hi>Delicius,</hi> my ſelfe and <hi>Stela</hi> (if <hi>Stela</hi> perhaps grewe afterwards to be more gentle) might in the meane time be ſecure in mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany togither.
<hi>Parthenius</hi> therefore beginning his walkes in this ſorte, fierce
<hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorost</hi> came downe from a high hill, whom when <hi>Parthenius</hi> beheld, he ſat him downe vpon a round banke made by the water, and plaied on his Baggepipe ſo loud that <hi>Gorphoroſt</hi> might heare him. But ſcarce had the ſound thereof pierced his eares, when ſtep by ſtep (which any other Shepherd with running very faſt could not out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe) he came to the riuer bankes on the other ſide: when <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſawe him nigh at hande, he left his Baggepipe, and taking his Rebecke, began to ſing in the praiſe of loue (for afterwards he told vs all the matter) the which, for that it made for his purpoſe, as alſo for the ſweetnes of the ſong, delighted not a litle the fierce ſhepherd, who had foorthwith paſſed to the other ſide where <hi>Parthenius</hi> was, if he had not fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vpon him vnawares, to haue made him run away, though he was now ſomewhat aſſured to the contrarie: when hee ſawe <hi>Parthenius</hi> (being ſo nigh vnto him) not once begin to ſtir, nor to leaue of his ſinging, whereon preſuming a little, he ſpake thus vnto him aloude (for the diſtance of the place by reaſon of the great riuer being betweene, &amp; the noiſe which the waters running with great force conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually made, were an impediment that he could not be ſo well heard.) So may this God be euer fauourable vnto thee (iolly Shepherd) if thou wilt giue mee leaue to come to thee, to enioy part of thy ſweete muſicke and ſongs: for by her, that hath ſole power ouer my hart I ſweare, thou ſhalt not nowe, nor at any time heereafter <pb n="264" facs="tcp:23115:135"/>haue any harme at my hands.
<hi>Parthentus</hi> hereupon made him a ſigne to come ouer, which he did out of hand, and there they gaue to each other a particular account of their liues,
<hi>Parthenius</hi> hauing euer a ſpeciall care to conceale that, which by reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, might be hurtfull vnto him. They paſſed away the time there a good while, when at the laſt <hi>Parthenius</hi> played and ſung ſuch things, as pleaſed <hi>Gorphoroſts</hi> vain, wherewith the fierce Shepherd was not onely moſt highly content, but no leſſe glad, that he had got a companion and friend, to whom he might impart his vneuen loues with
<hi>Stela.</hi> In this ſort therefore they ſpent that day, and tooke their leaue of one another, <hi>Gorphorost</hi> requeſting him not to forget that place of meeting. While <hi>Parthenius</hi> was a gaining <hi>Gorphorosts</hi> good will, (wherein he had ſo much profited himſelfe by his paſſing wit and diſcretion, that in his armes to the other ſide of the riuer he oftentimes tranſported him, to ſhew him all his riches and habitation) I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to pacifie angrie <hi>Stela,</hi> wherein I tooke ſuch paines, and was ſo forward, that I had put her (as it were) in <hi>Cupids</hi> boſome, to make her know his ſorce and ſignory; and in ſuch ſort, that though ſhe had no force to reſiſt loue, yet ſhe encouraged her ſelfe to paſſe away her paine without diſcouering it once vnto me, being her chiefeſt ſecretarie, and deereſt friend: Neuertheleſſe I ſtudied by all meanes poſſible (by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing <hi>Delicius</hi> pardon) to make her returne to her former companie and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereupon, when moſt of our Nymphes were on a time in ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies agreed to paſſe awaie the heate of the daie, I ſaide vnto her. I cannot but greeue (beloued
<hi>Stela</hi>) that for ſo light an occaſion wee ſhoulde leeſe ſo many pleaſant howers as wee were wont to haue. Truth it is <hi>Crimine</hi> (ſaide <hi>Stela</hi>) that I would faine enioy them, if they were entertained with ſuch puritie and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie as at the firſt we found them: And I know not why thou ſhouldſt terme it light, when to thy ſelfe (as at the leaſt to me it ſeemed) it ſhould be no leſſe heauie to indure. What harme didſt thou get by it (ſaid I) or how couldeſt thou be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that ſo iollie a yoong Shepherd, ſo wiſe, and diſcreet ſhould loue thee (I know) with ſuch apparant tokens of true and ſincere affection; whom neither <hi>Apollo,</hi> when he fedde <hi>Admetus</hi> heards, nor any other did euer excell in any thing. And how more auaileable (if not for their deſerts) were it for vs to haue their companie, to no other end, but to paſſe away the heate of theſe daies, which well thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſſemble, ſince in the end thy will remaines ſo free to do whatſoeuer ſhall like thee beſt. Should I conſent (ſaid
<hi>Stela</hi>) to haue one loue me beyond the limits of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie? Why this (ſaid I) is not in thy power, bicauſe thou canſt not let it: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> to leaue of to loue thee, and thou ſhalt ſee how much thy deſire or command preuailes. I know it well (ſaid <hi>Stela</hi>) but then muſt I ſuffer him to manifeſt ſo diſhoneſt a motion to me? Thou art in the fault (ſaid I) by prouoking him firſt vnto it, as if (it ſeemed) thou hadſt no other deſire. By meanes whereof the careleſſe and ſimple louer, thinking there was no ſuch hidden deceit in thee (as with thy faire words to draw that out of his breſt, which with faſt and ſecret bonds he had enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there) and thinking to take opportunitie by the forehead, plainly laied open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee his vnfayned and feruent affection; wherein thou wert much beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſince otherwiſe (perhaps) he would neuer haue manifeſted it (by paſſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the meane time great paines for feare of offending thee) vntill thou didſt firſt command him. Since it is then ſo (ſaide <hi>Stela</hi>) that thou wilt lay this fault vpon me, I will take the blame and puniſhment vpon my ſelfe, which ſhal be heereafter not to ſee nor ſpeake with him, nor to haue any thing to do with him, bicauſe I will not fall with him into more errours: And as for him let him taſte the fruite of his owne <pb n="265" facs="tcp:23115:135"/>boldnes, which puniſhment as it will not (I thinke) be greeuous to me to ſuffer, ſo will it not be hurtfull to him, to gather that which he himſelfe did ſowe: How eaſie a thing it is for thee (ſaid I) I ſee well, but how hard it is for him, I cannot conceiue, aſſuring thee, that if thou hadſt but ſeene him at that preſent, thou wouldſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der better of that I ſay, who is yet in ſuch a caſe, that thou art ſcarce able to knowe him; with whoſe teares and burning ſighes the hard dimonds and chriſtall may be mollified and melted. And beleeue me <hi>Stela,</hi> if it had not beene for me and <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> that did put him in ſome vncertaine hope, bicauſe he ſhoulde not deſpaire, he had before this time paied deerely for his fault, (if by doing thy command, he made a fault) though yet in the end I greatly feare me that he cannot endure very long, if thou doſt ſtay too long from viſiting him, who now requires no other thing for his onely ſatisfaction and content. Truely (ſaid <hi>Stela</hi>) thou haſt termed them wel (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine hopes) for ſo they are indeede, and of vncertaine they ſhall be for euer vaine. When I perceiued her hardnes, and of what ſmall force my perſwaſions were, with mine eies full of teares I ſaid vnto her. Ah <hi>Stela</hi> how ill doſt thou requite my great loue towards thee, how ſmall an account doſt thou make of the loue, that thou oweſt me, and howe ill doſt thou thinke of the tender affection, which I haue euer vowed vnto thee? the reuenge of all which (if with ſpeede thou doſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my enſuing ſorrow) I craue at the iuſt hands of our impartiall Gods. Speaking thus vnto her, and renting the fine vaile that weakely couered my amorous breſts, with many ſighes, and ſo profounde, that my breath ſeemed to burſt my inwarde ſoule, I foulded mine armes, and leaning my head vpon my knees (for then I was ſet downe) I made ſtrange and pitious motions with my bodie. <hi>Stela</hi> ſtoode aſtoniſhed at ſuch a ſight, not knowing whereunto ſhe might attribute ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, and ſo was ſhe in a great ſuſpence, vnable to ſpeake or do any thing, but weepe for loue and pitie (not knowing wherefore) onely thereby to keepe me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie: and a little while after embracing me, ſhe began thus to ſay. My deere Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Miſtreſſe, if this offence which without reaſon (as I know no leſſe) thou haſt conceiued againſt me, thou takeſt in ill part at the firſt, I do no leſſe wonder at this new accident, that thy vnwonted teares mooue me thus to pitie. Tell me wherein I am culpable, or how I haue offended thee; and beware thou putteſt me not in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thy friendſhip to me is ſtained and vnpure, when as mine hath euer beene towards thee vertuous, and ſincere. For thou ſayeſt I requite thee ill, bicauſe I will not ſee that preſumptuous Shepherd. O my deere friend
<hi>Stela</hi> (ſaid I) how faine would I be as thou art, that I might with that libertie that thou haſt, tell thee the cauſe of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints, or that thou wert as I am, to heare with my ſubiection, What reaſon I haue to make them, and to accuſe thee. But in the end with the poſſibilitie that I ſhall attaine to, and as ſhortly as I can, I will tell it thee, to take away that ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition which thou haſt of me, and not to conceale any ſecret matter from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an vnlawful part to our right of mutual friendſhip. The reaſon that iuſtly moues me to complaine of thee is, that thou wilt not go ſee <hi>Delicius,</hi> and this is for another matter then thou thinkeſt of, and therefore be attentiue, It is now cleere enough to thee, what great loue and amitie is betweene both the brothers, which hath made
<hi>Parthenius</hi> feele the griefe of his friend <hi>Delicius</hi> no leſſe then he did himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is in as great dauunger of his life: For when <hi>Delicius</hi> falling downe, had loſt his colour, and was in ſuch an agonie, <hi>Parthenius</hi> was in no leſſe to ſee his friend in ſuch a caſe, that thou wouldeſt haue thought the laſt period of both their liues had beene come, who had beene long ſince deliuered from their paines, if by ſome ſmall hope <pb n="266" facs="tcp:23115:136"/>I had not reuiued them; yet thinking that either of them would be glad to liue, not for himſelfe, but bicauſe the other might liue: for both of them knew well that one of their liues could laſt no longer then the other enioyed his, ſo that denying to go ſee <hi>Delicius,</hi> thou leaueſt <hi>Parthenius</hi> in great danger. Thou wilt (perhaps) aske me, what I haue to do with the good or ill fare of this vnhappie Shepherd, by ſeeling it ſo much as I do: faine would I haue another tell thee this, but in the end ſetting all virgin modeſtie aſide with thee, ſince it lies in my power to do no leſſe, Thou muſt know, that ſince theſe Shepherds came hither for their ill (I will not ſay for mine, for though their ſight coſt me tenne thouſand liues, I cannot yet denie but that I haue beene happie) I am not able to tell thee how I yeelded to loues commaund, being forced to loue <hi>Delicius</hi> no leſſe then <hi>Parthenius;</hi> for I neuer found any thing, wherein I liked the one more then the other: with which doubt, not knowing to what ſide to adhere, I was certaine daies in ſuſpence; but afterwards knowing that
<hi>Delicius</hi> was in loue with thee, and <hi>Parthenius</hi> free, I thought it beſt not to make my ſelfe ſubiect to him who was alreadie a captiue, but to the other, whoſe loue hath made ſo forcible an impreſſion in my vnarmed hart, that without him my life is hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me. Thou ſeeſt therefore by this, faire <hi>Stela,</hi> how for that which concernes me ſo much, I wiſh ſome content to <hi>Delicius.</hi> It can coſt thee but a little (deere friend) to pardon him for the good that I ſhall gaine, when alſo no harme can redound to thee thereby, &amp; the rather ſince he craues pardon of thee with proteſtation neuer after to offend thee. Thou demandeſt a hard matter at my hand (ſaide <hi>Stela</hi>) but bicauſe I ſee thy teares, which I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſuffer to iſſue out in ſuch abundance, wherby thou doſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the greefe which thou feeleſt, and bicauſe thou maieſt not haue any occaſion to complaine of my friendſhip, I will do that which I thought not to do; but on ſuch a condition, that thou ſhalt neuer complaine on me againe, if by committing anie other ſuch fault, I denie <hi>Delicius</hi> my ſight for euer: whom I would alſo knowe, that neither he, nor any deſert of his part could obtaine pardon for ſo great a fault, if he had not procured ſo good a mediatour: for it is not my will, that for his ſake thou ſhouldſt thanke me for it. Embracing her then for this curteſie and gentle offer, that ſhe made me, I thanked her for it, and with her good leaue went my waies (imagine how glad) to ſeeke out my Shepherds, and found <hi>Delicius</hi> all alone, for
<hi>Parthenius</hi> was with <hi>Gorphorost.</hi> Needleſſe it is to tell you if <hi>Delicius</hi> was glad to ſee me come to him with another kinde of countenance, then I was woont ſome daies before, for as I promiſed him, ſo I performed, to go and ſee him: who perceiuing now my ſignes of gladnes, ſaid vnto me. The only hope of my health, &amp; comfort in my cares, doſt thou bring thy noble hart ſo ioyful, as thy gracious countenance ſo full of content? Tel me quickly, without more circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances, for thou knoweſt that <hi>A good deed quickly done, is twiſe done,</hi> although it be but one: by which words knowing him to be <hi>Delicius,</hi> I ſaid. To morrow thou ſhalt ſee <hi>Stela.</hi> What do I liue (ſaide
<hi>Delicius?</hi>) If between this and then thou doſt not die, ſaide I. In her good grace, ſaid he? If thou wilt ſaid I. O good words, ſaid he. But thou muſt do better deedes, ſaid I. Doubt not of that, ſaid he, but that I do, and will make it the higheſt and beſt deed in the worlde to loue
<hi>Stela</hi> my trueſt ſoule. O <hi>Delicius</hi> (ſaide I) how do I conceiue, that thy great loue, or the ſmall diſſembling thereof (I will not ſay ſmall knowledge) will be heere-after hurtfull to thee. Let come what will (ſaide <hi>Delicius</hi>) for I will rather ioy to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for louing too much (if there be any exceſſe in loue) then to bee harmed for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too little. I will not counſell thee (ſaid I) not to loue, for it would auaile mee nothing at all: But I muſt tell thee, that it is expedient for thee not a little to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble <pb n="267" facs="tcp:23115:136"/>thine affection, eſpecially before <hi>Stela,</hi> if thou wilt not be onely odious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, but alſo depriued of her deſired preſence. By performance whereof, knowe that ſhe will make truce with thee for her part and for thine. Not for my part (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Delicius</hi>) although I ſhould yet paſſe greater harmes by this occaſion, which cannot be greater then theſe which I haue alreadie ſuffred: But in the end ſhe hath made ſuch truce according to her will, that ſhe hath ſeemed the conquerour, ſince none is able to come to reſiſt her hand to hand. Well, well, ſaid I, time conſumeth many things, and it may be that amongſt ſo many, the anger of thy <hi>Stela</hi> may alſo be forgotten. God grant it (anſwered <hi>Delicius</hi>) but not to the preiudice of my great loue. Tell me (ſaid I) what is become of thy brother, or where is he, that he is not with thee? In faith (ſtept out
<hi>Doria</hi> and ſaid) I was not a little woondring with my ſelfe that all this while thou didſt not aske for thy <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ſince thou wert ſo pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and loſt (or at the leaſt as thou haſt made ſhewe) ſo much in his loue, which made me long to aske thee the cauſe thereof. Loſt ſaideſt thou, nay rather found ſaid <hi>Crimine,</hi> and happie in it. But I will anſwer to that which thou haſt asked. If aſſoone as I came, I had asked for him, <hi>Delicius</hi> woulde haue thought, that my cheefeſt intent was to ſee <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and not to helpe him, which (to get the good will of both) was no good way at all. I coulde giue thee other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (faire Nymph) but let this ſuffice. But returning to that I was telling, when I asked for <hi>Parthenius, Delicius</hi> ſaide, he was gone to
<hi>Gorphorost,</hi> and tolde me of the new friendſhip lately begun between them both: whereof though I was ſomewhat afraide; yet I could not thooſe, but thinke well of his policie to tary the ſafer and longer time in thoſe parts. I would haue ſtayed for him vntill he had come, to haue counſelled him, how he might haue conuerſed and behaued himſelfe with that fierce Shepherd. But I muſt needs go, bicauſe <hi>Delicius</hi> told me, that he would not come ſo ſoone againe; for that <hi>Gorphorost</hi> was determined to ſhewe him the Iland, and the Caue where he dwelt. The next day before our accuſtomed hower, chalenging <hi>Stela</hi> for her promiſe, I carried her with me to the wonted place, the which a Nymph (to whoſe lot it befell that day) watched (as I ſaid) to ſee if any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was at hand. We going on therefore that way, and <hi>Stela</hi> ſeeing the ſhadowes to be but narrow, ſaid: We go too ſoone, for the Shepherds be not yet come: and admit they were, it is not decent nor conuenient for vs to go before our accuſtomed howers, bicauſe they might not thinke, that being ſo deſirous to ſee them, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented our wonted time: If therefore (friend) thou thinkeſt good, let vs goe into the thickeſt of the forreſt here, to walke vnder the ſhades, while it is fitter time to go. I told her I was content, &amp; bad her leade the way. But going in this ſort from tree to tree, we might perceiue in the tender barke of a great and tall aſhe, from as high as a man of more then a meane ſtature, might reach from the ground, certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes written verie ſmall and cloſe togither, and comming to the ſame to ſee what they were, I began to read them as followeth.</p>

               <p>With the taſte of this ſorrowfull ſong I will now leaue of, which me thinkes is of great ſubſtaunce, whether the affection I beare the Shepherde that wrote it, makes me thinke ſo (for by the wordes thereof you may vnderſtand it was written by <hi>Delicius</hi>) or that then the reading, and now the recitall of it, whereby the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of the poore youth was then and now repreſented vnto me, doth make me iudge it to be no leſſe I know not: Aſſuring you, that then for a little I woulde not haue made an ende to read it out, though I had ſought it in euery place, if the teares which fell ſo faſt from mine eies to ſee the greefe of ſo faire and vnfortunate a yoong Shepherd, had not let me. Tell me no ſuch thing (ſaide Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) for if I thought thou hadſt not as well read the other, which he ſaide he went to write in another tree, I would intreat thee to recite this once againe: but we ſhall haue time enough (if it pleaſe the Gods) to heare out the reſt. But what will you ſay (ſaid
<hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>) if I ſhould tell you, that we neuer remembred to ſeeke out the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I beleeue thee not anſwered Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> for ſo ſmal care ſhould not (me thinks) befall in women of ſo great reſpect, and in thee eſpecially, who didſt loue him with ſuch tender care and affection. Not to deceiue thee therefore nor thy imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſaide
<hi>Crimine</hi>) know Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> that we ſought and found it out. O how haſt thou reioiced my hart, ſaide <hi>Feliſmena!</hi> but take heede heereafter <hi>Crimine</hi> what thou ſayeſt: and if wee ſhall continue friendes, I praie thee mocke vs no more in this ſort, for thou hadſt not a little troubled my minde by making mee beleeue, that thou hadſt not ſought it out. But ſtate yet (ſaide <hi>Doria</hi>) for I am not of your opinion, that ſhe ſhoulde recite this other ſong ſo ſoone as you woulde haue her. Why ſaide Lord <hi>Felix?</hi> Bicauſe I woulde firſt knowe, ſaide <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> if it be ſuch an one as the laſt, for if it be not, ſhe did well to leaue of her tale at ſuch a point; for it is not the condition of my palate, to remaine with an ill taſte, when it hath once a good one. Verie true, ſaid <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> What anſwereſt thou therefore <hi>Crimine</hi> to this? I haue not perhaps the ſame taſte (ſaid I) that ſhe hath; ſo that it may be that what is ſweete to her, may ſeeme bitter to me, or contrarie: for in taſtes there is no ſmall difference. But for my ſelfe I can ſay, that the reſt to come pleaſeth me no leſſe, then that which is paſt. Then by this reaſon (ſaid Lord
<hi>Felix</hi>) thou maiſt tel it, which I beleeue thou wilt not otherwiſe chooſe to do with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that <hi>Doria</hi> alleaged vnto thee. Since you haue faire Ladies (ſaide <hi>Polydora</hi>) ſtaide your ſelues more then I would in queſtions and anſwers, I will alſo propound mine. Of which I dare lay a wager you will confeſſe, that one of them wil ſeeme bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you then all the reſt. And for this I wil not cal any other to be iudges, but your ſelues; and in faith not to appeale in any time from the ſentence giuen. Thou takeſt much vpon thee (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) and more, leauing it in the arbitrement of theſe that <pb n="272" facs="tcp:23115:139"/>be contrarie to thee. Nay rather little (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) for I know well that for your credits you dare not but pronounce it in my fauour. Tell it then to trie (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix.</hi>) You all take vpon you (ſaid <hi>Polydora</hi>) not meanely to be in loue, and prayſing (not without good cauſe) the ſong, and hauing heard <hi>Crimine</hi> confeſſe, that ſhe could not make an end to read it for pitie ſhe had of <hi>Delicius,</hi> what is the reaſon, that you haue not asked any thing what he did, or what <hi>Stela</hi> felt, or what impreſſion it made in her? Theſe are queſtions more woorthe the asking of louers, then to bee ſo preciſe in demaunding, if it were written or not, and if ſhee ſawe the other, or not? It would haue greeued mee (being no louer) if ſhe had not beene condolent for him, who was put in ſuch anxieties, and you that affirme it to be ſo, ſeeme not to be ſorrowfull for this paſſion; whereby it ſeemes you haue no deſire to helpe him with ſo much as a worde.
<hi>Polydora</hi> gaue them all great delight with her friendly anger, which ſhee ſhewed in ieſt, of whom there was not anie that thought not, but that ſhe was in good earneſt, if in the ende ſhe had not laughed. Then all with one voice ſaide, that the verdict ſhould paſſe on her ſide. Euery one holding their peace to ſee what <hi>Crimine</hi> would anſwer to it, ſhe began thus to ſaie. Thou haſt ſo highly conſidered the matter
<hi>Polydora</hi> that if thy demand had come ioyntly with the queſions of theſe Gentlemen, I would (to haue ſatisfied thine) (with pardon be it ſpoken) haue left theirs vnanſwered. And truely if loue had not required of
<hi>Stela</hi> a narrow account of the hardnes of her hart, then thine alſo had beene without an anſwer, bicauſe I thinke you would not giue any credite to my ſpeeches, not ſeeming a poſſible thing, that where all vertues are laid vp, pitie ſhould there be wanting, in whom I aſſure you, was no more ſhewe of mercie, then ſigne of heat in ſnow: Whereat if I tooke any greefe, wiſhing the Shepherd ſo much good, for the reaſon that I haue alleadged, thou maieſt (faire Nymph) coniecture. But I promiſe you now, that I haue no occaſion to complaine, for loue hath as well paied me for the offence, which then by her crueltie ſhe gaue me, that I may iuſtly complaine of too great pitie, which ſhe vſed towards him, ſince being ſuch, it hath beene too cruell for me in this behalfe. And for this time I will ceaſe, as well for that I wearie my ſelfe and you, as alſo for that
<hi>Felicia</hi> and the reſt come in very good time: who comming neere vnto them, <hi>Feliſmena</hi> ſaide. Lay thy hand of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon me Lady
<hi>Felicia,</hi> for I confeſſe I deſerue it, affirming that thy comming hath made me ſorie, &amp; hereof I know well who is in fault. The ſame all the reſt ſaid. Say you ſo (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) Then I ſweare to morrow you ſhall be all puniſhed for it. With this they went to ſupper and to reſt. If I ſhould ſet downe in order the braue daunces and ſongs, that after ſupper were plaied and ſung, it would be an endleſſe peece of worke.</p>

Dinner being done, Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena,</hi> and the Nymphes deſirous to knowe the reſt of that which <hi>Crimine</hi> had begun the day before, conſulted togither to get her out of the companie ſhe was in. Which ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> perceiuing, and what they went about, bad Lord <hi>Felix</hi> be content, and told them that ſhe would doe the beſt to fulfill their deſires. A little while after, ſhe went from thence to paſſe away the time with <hi>Pariſiles</hi> and
<hi>Crimine,</hi> and left <hi>Stela</hi> with them all, to tell out the reſt, bicauſe <hi>Crimine</hi> could not tell that which followed, ſo well as <hi>Stela,</hi> whereof <hi>Felicia</hi> informed Lord <hi>Felix.</hi> When dinner was done, <hi>Delicius</hi> went as he was woont to walke vp and downe in the woods, ſpending thoſe miſerable daies in ſorrowfull thoughts and teares. So that <hi>Felicia, Pariſiles,</hi> and
<hi>Crimine</hi> being gone, Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena,</hi> the Nymphes, and the Shepherdes remained with faire <hi>Stela,</hi> to whome
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> began thus to ſay. From that very inſtant (moſt excellent virgine) when firſt thou didſt diſcouer to vs thy vermillion and ſnow white face, we cleerely knew, that for ſingular beautie thou didſt get the prize and honour amongſt the faireſt whereſoeuer, and till yeſterday that <hi>Crimine</hi> ſhewed the hardnes of thy hart, we had not knowen, that thy exceeding crueltie deſerued the palme and victorie amongſt all mortall women. Renowned Ladie, ſaid <hi>Stela</hi> (cutting her off) I thinke it will not greeue thee, if I anſwere thy needeleſſe wordes after a rude ſort, ſince thou wilt giue me that but in wordes, which thou haſt deſerued in deede, I ſpeake it concerning thy more rare beautie. For, as for being cruell, I denie not but that I haue deſerued a reward, though I am now more worthie of a greater, for being on the contrarie ſo pitifull as thou ſeeſt. Thereof (ſaid <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) we know the firſt, and of the ſeconde being ignorant, doe vs therefore the fauour to rid vs out of this falſe opinion of thee. All of them with one voice likewiſe charged her with the ſame demaund. For many reſpects, ſaid
<hi>Stela,</hi> I cannot (woorthy companie) denie your earneſt requeſts, for one, bicauſe I was commaunded thereunto by ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> to whom I owe all obedience and reſpect of dutie: for another, to fulfill your commaunds, which I will not diſobey: and for the third, bicauſe I take a pleaſure in recounting mine owne paſſions, to trie if with the greefe which I ſhall haue in telling them, death will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer me once from them; which though for this reſpect I chiefly deſire, yet life is pleaſant to me, onely for no more, but to enioy the ſight of my yoong Shepherdes, to whom (mine honour reſerued) I haue ſacrificed my deereſt libertie. Other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I omit that mooue me to ſatisfie your mindes. And now bicauſe you are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to that point where my deere friend <hi>Crimine</hi> left, from that I will take my begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and proceede vnto the preſent eſtate that we are now in, aduiſing you by the way, that I durſt neuer open my mouth with ſuch boldnes to tell you of my loues, if of mine owne part there had euer beene the leſt ſtaine or thought of impuritie in them. The which thing affirmed as well by <hi>Crimine,</hi> as by that which I will rehearſe, ſhall ſoone appeere. And as I will alſo tell you (which my companion could not, but that which ſhe did openly ſee) what I did, and ſpake with my ſelfe alone, ſo cannot I report vnto you what ſhe or the Shepherdes did, or ſpake, when they were by themſelues alone. And if I ſhall tell you any thing that I haue not ſeene, it ſhall be after their owne report to me. Giue eare therefore, for now I begin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>CRimine</hi> could ſcarce pronounce the words of the ſong written in the tree, and recited by her, for pitie of <hi>Delicius</hi> (which we knew well by the tenor of it to be <pb n="274" facs="tcp:23115:140"/>his) for if they had held out longer, ſhe could not haue made an end of them, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read them, ſhe ſaid. Woe is me, how different are they in mind that are ſo like in face (for now you know how <hi>Crimine</hi> died for the loue of
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> and how ſhe had told me it) <hi>Delicius</hi> burnes in loue, and <hi>Parthenius</hi> is cold in the ſame. Me thinks it were good, that both of them ſhould loue like faithfull companions, or that
<hi>Stela</hi> and I like good friends ſhould hate. O <hi>Stela</hi> thou mighteſt well agree with <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> who in condition of cruelty is ſo like vnto thee, and ſhouldeſt forſake <hi>Delicius,</hi> ſo like to me. I aſſure you Gentlemen, that the pitifull verſes that
<hi>Delicius</hi> wrote in the tree, penetrated deepely into my ſoule, but the words that were fixed in <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines;</hi> ſorrowful breaſt, mooued me without compariſon to more ruth. The perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that
<hi>Crimine</hi> oftentimes vſed to me, to induce me to loue
<hi>Delicius</hi> were of great force, but this laſt was ſo ſtrong, that it wrought more effectually with me then al the reſt. <hi>Delicius</hi> his ſingular parts, and the rare deſerts of <hi>Parthenius</hi> were of great worth with me, by noting how worthie they were to be beloued; but the iealouſie I had of <hi>Crimine,</hi> perceiuing how glad ſhe was to be beloued of either of them was more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible in my minde. O loue, loue, how iuſtly do they paint thee like a blind boy, thy conditions being no other! For a boy with a broken pate, that will not ſuffer his head to be bound vp in a clout, but ſeeing the ſame tyed to another boies head, cries out for it: So was it with me and <hi>Crimine.</hi> I reiected the loue of the Shepherds, but knowing that <hi>Crimine</hi> loued them, I died for their loue, and wept in my inwarde ſoule that <hi>Crimine</hi> was ſo much deuoted to them. But marke my diſſimulation, for to that, which ſhee ſaide I aunſwered thus. To this laſt (my ſweete friende) which thou haſt alleaged (for as much as toucheth mee) thou maieſt well agree, not onely with
<hi>Delicius,</hi> but with his friend, if thou wilt. This is not well (ſaide
<hi>Crimine</hi>) that thou haſt yet ſo much libertie to graunt me ſuch leaue, but in the end, I am well content to take it: for I loue not
<hi>Delicius</hi> ſo little, that I would do him ſuch iniury, neither do I ſee him ſo enclined to yeeld to my loue again. And I ſee no reaſon (ſaid I) why I ſhould not giue thee leaue or any body elſe in this reſpect: let vs leaue this (ſaid ſhe) &amp; go if thou thinkeſt good whither we were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. Come on (ſaid I) let vs go whither we muſt, not whither we ſhould, for the ſooner we go, the ſooner we ſhal come back again. Being therfore come to our won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, we found the Shepherds merrie for the hope they had to ſee me, wherein I deceiued not my ſelfe, for if it was not ſo, I am then ſure I was well deceiued, though ſomwhat ſorrowful alſo for my long ſtaying. We therefore comming before the faire Shepherds, a certaine feare poſſeſſed both their bodies, no otherwiſe then if ſome fearefull and ghaſtly thing had ſuddenly appeered before their ſight, ſo that it cauſed a notable trembling in euery part of them.
<hi>Crimine</hi> went on ſixe ſteps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (it might be to bid
<hi>Delicius</hi> take courage and a good hart) and afterwards ſpake out aloud to them ſaying. By force (my friends) I bring this my companion hither to eſtabliſh a louing peace betweene you and her. <hi>Delicius</hi> would haue anſwered, but <hi>Crimine</hi> fearing leaſt his loue woulde haue made a fault in ſomething, cut him off, following her ſpeech thus. For confirmation whereof, there is nothing more requiſite, but that without remembrance of that which is paſt, we returne againe to our former paſtimes. Truth it is, that I will not diſſwade <hi>Delicius</hi> from asking her pardon, whom he hath mooued to anger, and her I beſeech by the faith of our friendſhip not to denie the ſame. Then ſaide
<hi>Delicius</hi> by and by, his eies full of teares, and his knees on the ground, not onely for the offence committed, but if in any thing I ſhall heereafter offend her, with all humilitie I aske her forgiuenes. If ſo
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:23115:140"/>for nought (ſaide I) a fault ſhould be ſolde, it would be held but for a ſport and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime in lieu of ſatisfying your wils, to giue occaſion of anger, howſoeuer by redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it onely with pardon craued and obtained. So that truſt not to this Shepherd: for the ſecond ſhall not be forgiuen thee ſo good cheape. Wouldſt thou haue him liue ſo preciſely faire <hi>Stela,</hi> (ſaid <hi>Parthenius</hi>) and in ſuch continual feare, that he dare not onely ſpeake, nor ſo much as breath for feare of offending thee? I coulde not chooſe but laugh at
<hi>Parthenius</hi> words, and at the countenance wherewith he ſpake them: To the which I anſwered thus. Gracious thou art in ſooth iolly Shepherd, that art ſo ready to helpe thy companion, I do not meaneit ſo extreamely, as thou ſaieſt, he vnderſtands me well enough: I imagine as much ſaid
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> but am not ignorant, that thou art rigorous, and that in this ſort we are both in an ill caſe, if for ſpeaking perhaps or doing a light thing ignorantly, one ſhoulde not be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If ſo ſmall faults are ſo heynouſly puniſhed, howe can the greater eſcape vncorrected? Wherefore ſet downe this lawe (if thou wilt at the leaſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted iuſt) that the puniſhment exceede not the fault, putting the fault and the puniſhment in an equall ballance of moderation: We are more bound to our Gods for mercy, which they ſhew vs, then for their iuſtice, whereby but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle they profite themſelues. Tell me then faire <hi>Stela</hi> (as the Gods preſerue thee ſtill in thy ſingular and rare beautie) if euery time that men offende, high <hi>Ioue</hi> ſhoulde ſende downe his thunderbolts, howe manie doſt thou thinke ſhoulde hee finde vnarmed? I impute it not Gentlemen, to any pride, arrogancie, or neceſſitie of mine owne part, if lying, ſometimes I ſay (faire <hi>Stela</hi>) which are formall words of Shepherds, and commonly vſed of them, which beſides (although I might well leaue vnſpoken) yet could it not be well ſuffred, bicauſe they are not without myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. It is well (ſaid <hi>Doria</hi>) let it be as thou wilt, and tell on, for we will not ſtay our ſelues vpon ſo apparant a matter as this. I anſwered <hi>Parthenius</hi> (ſaid <hi>Stela.</hi>) That the errour committed is well manifeſted, but after what ſort ſhall the ignorance thou ſpeakeſt of be cleere vnto me? But I ſee thee <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſo free in thy ſpeeches, and bitter in thy reprehenſions, that I ſhall be forced with my will, yea, and for very feare, to do ſomething for thee.
<hi>Parthenius</hi> without more adoe humbled himſelfe with
<hi>Delicius,</hi> who was all this while at my feete, for of purpoſe I would not bid him riſe, deſirous to ſee them both equally yeeld themſelues vnto me, bicauſe I equally loued them both, and being in this ſort, he ſaid. If it be then ſo, I beſeech thee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, ſince he craues it on thee with ſo great humilitie. I am content (ſaid I) and taking them both by the hands, I lifted them vp, which when I had done, <hi>Crimine</hi> ſaid. Tell me <hi>Parthenius</hi> how fals it out, thou art not with thy friend
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> to day? <hi>Parthenius</hi> anſwered, bicauſe I knew faire <hi>Stela</hi> would come hither to day. And not bicauſe I came, ſaid
<hi>Crimine?</hi> Thou haſt no cauſe to aske me this queſtion (gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Nymphe) anſwered <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ſince thou art aſſured, I would do it no leſſe for thine, but onely bicauſe faire <hi>Stelas</hi> preſence was ſo much deſired, by reaſon of theſe paſſed diſcontents. One thing I haue marked, ſaid <hi>Crimine,</hi> whereof I ſhould not be a little aſhamed, if there were any other heere beſides
<hi>Stela,</hi> that thou doſt call her euermore (faire) and me (gracious.) Thou maiſt vrge me ſo farre ſaide he, that I may confeſſe my ſelfe ouercommed. Friend <hi>Crimine,</hi> ſaid I, their faults cannot take away the due praiſe of thy beautie, ſo that if thine were deemed by right and indifferent iudges, it ſhould euer haue the prize and ſuperioritie. And whom ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi> ſhall we appoint for ſuch iudges? My ſelfe ſaid I, and thoſe, whom thou wilt beſides, that are of better iudgement and skill, then theſe Shepherdes. Why, what ſaieſt thou,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:23115:141"/>ſaid <hi>Crimine?</hi> I anſwered, that which I ſaid. This ſufficeth me, ſaid <hi>Crimine,</hi> and now I care not a whit for that they ſhall ſay, ſince the ſentence is giuen with a better vow and voice in my fauour. In theſe and other ieſtes (which I omit to tell you, bicauſe I know you are deſirous to heare the other ſong) we ſpent a pretie time, wherein, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we had ſung ſome merie and ioyfull ditties, we heard the ſound, that the Nymph our watch woman gaue, to hie vs home, becauſe <hi>Gorphorost</hi> was comming downe the hils beneath; whereupon with the greateſt haſte we could, we hied vs away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to paſſe ouer the riuer: Who by chaunce eſpying vs, with humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts began to perſwade vs not to flie away, ſince it was not his mind to offend vs in any thing: To whoſe bootleſſe ſpeeches, hating him for mine own part as much as I loued the Shepherds, I would not abide to liſten; though
<hi>Crimine</hi> requeſted me to ſtay a pretie way off, to ſee what he would ſay, and if offring to come neere vs, he would not go backe, with warning him to the contrarie, we might then be gone, and ſaue our ſelues, being in ſo ſure a place as then we were. But I, that had no deſire to condeſcend to <hi>Crimines</hi> requeſt, with my company entred no ſooner into our riuer, when <hi>Gorphorost</hi> came on the other ſide where my deere Shepherds were. To whom he ſaide. <hi>Parthenius</hi> (which of you two ſoeuer he be) although by thee, your like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was ſo fully made knowen vnto me; yet I thought it was not ſo great, that it might trouble mee from knowing thee againe. Nowe I confeſſe, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, which of you two is
<hi>Parthenius.</hi> Speake therefore to mee both of you, and by your voice I ſhall diſcerne that, which by your countenaunce and apparell I cannot. Then they ſaide both togither: I am <hi>Parthenius.</hi> If I had not ſeene you both mooue your lippes (ſaide <hi>Gorphorost</hi>) I woulde haue thought it had beene but one voice. Do me therefore this pleaſure to ſpeake each one by himſelfe, and then by that meanes I ſhall knowe you. <hi>Delicius</hi> ſpeaking firſt ſaid. I am <hi>Parthenius,</hi> doſt thou not know me?
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> ſaid yes, and that very wel. Then ſpake
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> and ſaid. I am <hi>Parthenius,</hi> doſt thou not know me? Now, ſaid <hi>Gorphorost</hi> I know not thee, nor the other. But which of both ſoeuer thou beeſt, for the friendſhip betweene thee and me, I pray thee ſing thoſe verſes, which thou didſt ſing the firſt time I ſawe thee, for I neuer remembred to demand it ſooner at thy hands, and when I heard thee firſt ſing it, I could not vnderſtand them well, being both ſo farre aſunder. <hi>Parthenius,</hi> who (as you knowe) deſired to giue him all the content he could, taking out his Rebecke, began to ſing this Sonnet which he had made of purpoſe, bicauſe with patience he might ſuffer the diſdaine that I did beare him.</p>

               <p>O how glad would I haue beene, ſaid <hi>Syluanus,</hi> to haue heard this Sonnet, when I poured out ſo many vaine teares, and had ſo many disfauours of ingratefull <hi>Diana.</hi> What comfort couldſt thou haue had, ſaide <hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſince his purpoſe and intent doth maruellouſly import, that they are the pleaſures and ioyes of loue, to faine (without any cauſe thereof) that they are not loued, ſo that to vnderſtand, that they are not loued (hauing good cauſe to beleeue it) they ſhould be no ſweetes nor dainties of loue. Whereupon perceiuing ſo cleerely that <hi>Diana</hi> did not loue thee, thou ſhouldſt haue had but ſmall comfort by this Sonnet. I perceiued well enough, anſwered <hi>Syluanus;</hi> that I was deſpiſed, but yet for all that, would not conceiue, that I knew ſo much. It is well ſaide (ſaide <hi>Doria</hi>) talke no more of times that are gone and paſt, ſince both of you are content with this, that is preſent. And thou faire <hi>Stela</hi> for the loue of vs all proceede in thy ſweet diſcourſe. In many other ſongs (ſaid <hi>Stela</hi>) they paſſed away a good time with ſicice <hi>Gorpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rost:</hi> and now that
<hi>Titan</hi> went downe to viſite the other earth, he tooke his leaue of them, requeſting <hi>Parthenius</hi> to come and viſite him ſometimes, promiſing him, that when he came to paſſe ouer the riuer, he woulde not faile to come and helpe him ouer. That night I ſlept not ſoundly in my bed, nor with much reſt, for ſo manie imaginations of things that I had paſſed the day before, &amp; of many other more, ran vp and down in my troubled fantaſies, that I could take no reſt at all. For I thought of the goodly behauiour, graces, and beautie, and perſonage of the two Shepherds, each thing in them ſeeming to me (being not men of flockes as I ſuppoſed) more woorthie of greater things then my ſelfe. The ſorrowfull wordes of
<hi>Delicius</hi> ſong written in the tree, filled me full of pirie, and the frantike iealouſie that (rooted in my hart) I had of <hi>Crimine</hi> for
<hi>Parthenius</hi> ſake, ſtung me mortally. On the one ſide I endeuoured not to loue, and was vnwilling on the other, that any ſhould loue them beſides my ſelfe. In the trouble of which conſiderations hauing a good while tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyled my wearied ſpirits, at the very point when faire
<hi>Aurora</hi> began to awake, a profound ſleepe began to take more holde on me, then in the whole night before. I dreamed, but will not tell you what, bicauſe I deſire to forget it: let it ſuffice, that th'extreme fear of ſo horrible a dream awaking me, eaſed me in ſom ſort. Seeing my ſelfe free from that danger, as if my bed had beene in fault, the onely cauſe of my ſorrowe, and full of ſtinging vipers, and fierie flames, with a ſudden ſeare I lept out of it. At the noiſe whereof <hi>Crimine,</hi> who lay with me, awaked, and enquiring the cauſe of my ſurſault, I anſwered her, that it was nothing but a ſtarte in a fearefull and vnacquainted dreame: which ſhould not be a ſmall one (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) ſince (my friend) it hath altered thee ſo much, that there is no colour left in thy face, but ſuch as in dead &amp; pale bodies; and thine eies ſwelling with ſeares, not yet ſully aſcended vp to iſſue foorth, ſeeme to burſt, for the great force and deſire they haue to weepe. It was ſo ſaid I, for I would haue thought they had opened my breſt. <hi>Crimine</hi> with a gracious ſmile (who is no leſſe in all ſhe doth) began to ieſt a little with me, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacing my bodie, &amp; looking into my breſt, ſaid. Truely thy dreame hath not ſhewed thee any thing contrary to the truth, for it is open, and hath beene to receiue into it there all poſſibilitie of beautie. And yet if thou wilt giue me leaue, I will tell thee more. She had little neede to aske me leaue, that tooke it of her-ſelfe ſo frankly to tell me what ſhee did. But tell me what thou wilt (ſaide I.) Although thy breſt, ſaid ſhe is open, yet hath <hi>Delicius</hi> his more open to receiue thee in. But rather thine <pb n="278" facs="tcp:23115:142"/>ſaide I, to locke vp <hi>Parthenius</hi> in it. That would not greeue me, ſaid ſhe, if this might be truely affirmed of thee and him: but knoweſt thou what is come into my minde, that we ſpent too ſhort time yeſterday in ſeeking out the reſt of the ſong, that was written in the tree: Why, what remained, ſaid I? This would I know ſaide <hi>Crimine.</hi> Doſt thou not remember that the laſt verſe of it ſaid, that bicauſe that tree was not able to containe any more, he went to write it in ſome other tree. It is true indeed, ſaid I. Now haſt thou come, ſaid <hi>Doria,</hi> to the point, which we all deſired to know: but <hi>Stela</hi> ſaid on, As thou loueſt thy felſe therefore (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) let vs goe a little ſooner to day, and we will ſeeke out the place, where he wrote the reſt, and to reade againe that, which we found yeſterday. Let it be as thou pleaſe, ſaid I. And ſo with this determination we went betimes to the place where we had beene the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and began againe to read the ſong, that we had read, but not without manie teares, where by and by not far from thence, we found out a great Sicamour, whoſe tender and white barke ſerued him for paper, for this which he wrote in it.</p>

               <p>Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> as ſoone as <hi>Stela</hi> had made an ende of the ſong, turned him to <hi>Polydora,</hi> ſaying. Art thou now ſatisfied? So much ſaid ſhe, that for a little I would not ſticke to ſay that it is better then the firſt. But knoweſt thou, what I thinke of it ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> That the firſt is finer &amp; pretier, &amp; this more ſententious &amp; witty, &amp; with this I am pleaſed: and it came finely in when he ſaid (&amp; very wel) that firſt the ill came to him before any good, ſince without widow-hood he ſuffered like griefe to the Turtle Doue; for he eſteemed it but a meane ſorrow to be a widower, bicauſe it was a ſigne of ſometime enioying the thing he loued. But it ſeemed a moſt greeuous thing vnto him, not hauing at any time the poſſeſſion of the thing he loued, to be depriued of it. Truely ſaid
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> thou art much beholding to him <hi>Stela,</hi> being ſo hard vnto him as thou wert, to cleere thee of all fault; and that none might be laid vpon thee, he ſaid: Thou wert not cruell, onely attributing his diſgrace to his ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But in one thing (ſaid <hi>Doria</hi>) he ſhewed his infinite loue, more then in any thing elſe, when he ſaid, he reſted not in any place. I might well haue noted ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> but that I would not hinder ſo pleaſant a diſcourſe. Tell on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faire <hi>Stela,</hi> as the Gods graunt thee thine owne deſires. Hauing made an end of reading this, that was in the Sicamour (ſaid
<hi>Stela</hi> proſecuting her tale) neither of vs could ſpeake for a good while, <hi>Crimine,</hi> for pitie, and I, for greefe. But afterwards
<hi>Crimine</hi> ſaid. Doſt thou thinke <hi>Stela,</hi> that I had not reaſon to helpe thy great need? What had become now of <hi>Delicius,</hi> if thy rigour and hardnes had laſted till this time? That which is now (I anſwered) and if any other thing had happened, I would not haue greatly cared. Say not ſo (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) for therein thou doſt offend thy ſelf. After this we went to the accuſtomed place to the Shepherdes, bicauſe we thought <pb n="282" facs="tcp:23115:144"/>it was no time. And being there in their ſweete and gracious company, my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſaid. I am euer, when I am with you my friendly Shepherds, not a little troubled in minde. They asked why ſo. Bicauſe to know you diſtinctly ſaide ſhe, ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward token and ſigne muſt be apparant, whereby I may know how to make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene you: whereas otherwiſe, I am as much deceiued, and know as little as they that haue frequented your companie leſſe then I; for if I turne but my head, I returne to the ſelfe ſame doubt, if (happily) in the meane time you haue chaunged places. For the cleering whereof, and for the friendſhip that is betweene vs, I pray thee, <hi>Stela,</hi> giue one of them a token, whereby we may know how to be aſſured of either of them, and not need to be troubled any more with this doubt. If thou haſt then ſo great a deſire (ſaid I) what needeſt thou require this at my hands, but that thou maiſt do it as well as I. Thou knoweſt now ſaid <hi>Crimine,</hi> that it was firſt deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of thee, and if it had not beene, it might ſuffice, that I requeſt it againe of thee. I deny not this ſaid I, but aſſure thee that of this great likenes and deceit, which troubles thy minde ſo much, I take great pleaſure. And it was ſo indeed: for as I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them in equall ſort; ſo my deſire was to haue them, not onely like in their exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſhewes, but all one in their interiour ſoules. I ſay as touching my ſelfe (ſo that I knew it) bicauſe I was then far from knowing the loue that <hi>Parthenius</hi> did ſecretly beare me, and not onely deſired (as I ſaid) to haue them ſtill like to one another, but that in truth they had beene both one. It muſt not euer be to thy liking (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) for it muſt ſometimes pleaſe mine a little. Let it be as thou wilt, ſaide I; and chooſe ſince it makes ſo much for thee. Good Lord (ſaide
<hi>Crimine</hi>) how frowarde art thou <hi>Stela?</hi> Heereaſter I will not requeſt thee to doe any thing, I will be gone, and tarie thou heere if thou wilt; if not, doe what thou wilt, for I knowe not nowe to what ende it will come. Staie, ſtaie, ſaide I: Goe not away, and bee not ſo angrie, for all ſhall bee done to thine owne deſire. In faith if it were not for theſe yoong Shepherdes ſakes (ſaide <hi>Crimine</hi>) I thinke thou ſhouldeſt ſee me no more heere. If then the matter be ſo, ſaid I, harke but one worde that I ſhall ſay vnto thee, and taking her aſide I ſaide vnto her. I would not by any meanes in the world giue more fauour to one then to the other, by giuing one a ſigne and the other none, leſt his wings (to whom I giue it) growe bigger then the others. Thou muſt therefore either giue me ſome time to thinke of it, or elſe counſell me how I muſt doe it. The wings to ſerue thee (ſhe anſwered) are now growen in <hi>Delicius,</hi> ſo that to him onely thou maieſt giue thy fauour; for as
<hi>Parthenius</hi> will not care for it ſo much at thy handes, ſo it likes me beſt that thou giueſt him none at all. <hi>Crimine</hi> thought not by ſpeaking theſe wordes, that ſhe did cut me to the very hart, but God knowes how much I felt them, yet diſſembling the matter the beſt I could, I anſwered. Though it likes thee not, yet will I giue to <hi>Parthenius</hi> his difference, as well as thy ſelfe, and I was not then in ieſt. But when doſt thou meane, ſaide ſhe, to make this difference betweene them? To morrow I anſwered. Shepherdes, ſaide <hi>Crimine</hi> alowde, turning to them, The difference that <hi>Stela</hi> will giue you with her owne hands, and the meanes how we ſhould know you, is deferred no further then to morrow. When it ſhall pleaſe her, ſaid they, for no other thing durſt they ſpeake. Being come thither the next day, I ſaid vnto them. My friends Shepherdes (for this name I cannot denie you, as long as your deſires reach not beyonde that, which is lawfull) although I haue beene vrged by my welbeloued friend to giue you ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of difference with mine owne hands, wherby we may come to the better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of you both; yet of mine owne free will, by leauing her requeſt aſide, I meane <pb n="283" facs="tcp:23115:144"/>to doe it. I deferred it yeſterday to this preſent hower, to thinke on it the better, and in what manner I ſhould giue it you without ſhewing any particular affection more to one then to the other; and as with equall loue I am ſoundly affected to you both, ſo was your great likeneſſe moſt agreeable to my minde. But as that which is iuſt and due muſt not be denied, ſo will I in ſuch ſort giue you the markes of your diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to ridde our ſelues out of doubt, and hold al others ſtill in it. And therewithal, you are not your ſelues (I thinke) able to iudge, when I know not my ſelfe, whether of you ſhall haue the greater fauour (if it deſerues ſuch a name) and bicauſe you may know, that partially I decline no more to one part then to another, vntill I haue made the ſame, I will not haue you make your ſelues knowen vnto me by worde nor ſigne, by diſcouering to me which is which, but that the lot may fall to whom it ſhal; and none refuſe or gainſay that which I ſhall now do, vnleſſe he will refuſe and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my good will from hencefoorth. When I had ſaid thus, I tooke out of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a little greene ribband, and put it with a bodkin in one of their coates neere to his hart; and then I went to the other, and clipping from him with a fine paire of Syſſers which I brought of purpoſe with me, a peece of darke greene lace from that part, where I had put the greene ribband in the other, I ſowed it on mine owne left ſide not farre from the ſecret ſeate of both their loues: Whereby I meant to giue them to vnderſtande, that to the one I gaue hope, and from the other I tooke tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Which being done I ſaide. Nowe may you declare to whom I haue giuen the greene ribband, and from whom I tooke the little peece of lace. Then it was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that to <hi>Delicius</hi> I gaue the firſt, and tooke the ſecond from <hi>Parthenius.</hi> Nowe that they had declared their names, and were knowne vnto vs, <hi>Delicius</hi> being glad and ioyfull for the gift giuen him by mine owne hand, with a certaine kind of meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſaide. Now doth the cauſe come to my remembrance (faire <hi>Stela</hi>) why <hi>Crimine</hi> hath beene ſo importunate with thee to make a difference betweene vs: O how glad would I be to know this, ſaid I, bicauſe I could neuer get it out of her. If thou wilt craue leaue and pardon of her (ſaide he) for me to tell it, I would quickly giue thee this contentment. Bicauſe ſhe may haue it (ſaide
<hi>Crimine</hi>) it pleaſeth me to graunt it, though it were to my coſt. Thou muſt then knowe ſaide <hi>Delicius,</hi> that though it hath beene the greateſt fauour, that we haue receiued at this preſent (as a gift of thine owne hands) yet that which was done to <hi>Parthenius</hi> in compariſon of this was moſt ſingular and great, being of greater qualitie in that kinde. And this it was, that when thou ſhewedſt ſuch rigour to me,
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> to ſee mee in ſuch an agonie (as gracious
<hi>Crimine</hi> thou knoweſt) was ſo much diſmaied, that he was in no leſſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then my ſelfe. For as I ſpake not a worde, but lying in ſuch a pitious trance, wherein he equally bare me companie, at laſt comming to my ſelfe againe, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning my head aſide to a certaine crie that
<hi>Crimine</hi> gaue, I ſawe her embrace <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> (a happie extaſie for him, ſince it was the occaſion of ſo ſweete a fauour done him) and holde his head face to face in her owne lappe. If any other thing paſſed betweene them, aske it of her, for I could ſee no more by reaſon of my late diſmaied ſences, not then perfectly reſtored. What thinkeſt thou of this faire <hi>Stela,</hi> what a ſoueraigne pitie was this? This he ſpake with a gracious ſmile, and had no ſooner made an end of telling it, when a vermillion bluſh teinted al our faces, though it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of different cauſes. It made <hi>Crimine</hi> bluſh with a decent ſhamefaſtenes, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with ioy of ſo delightfull a remembrance. It made
<hi>Parthenius</hi> bluſh for greefe and anger at the paſſed act; and me for iealouſie, incorporated with the offence of ſo vnwoorthie a deede againſt my loue. So that <hi>Delicius,</hi> thinking to make it but a
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:23115:145"/>ieſt, and to delight vs with it, found that it was in good earneſt, and filled vs full of ſorrow, and from that hower
<hi>Parthenius</hi> and I liked not ſo well of <hi>Crimine,</hi> though we made her not know ſo much; for ſhe was the meanes whereby we all three met and talked togither. Truth it is that now I haue forſaken the ill will that I did beare her, for diuers and ſundry good turnes, which I receiued of her; and ſeeing what great reaſon there is to loue them (as euery faire Nymph ſhoulde likewiſe doe) for mine own part I giue her leaue &amp; frank conſent to loue them as much as ſhe will: as alſo, bicauſe I ſee her not beloued of them, or (at the leaſt) not ſo much as my ſelfe, although in very truth (had they as perfect knowledge of her deſerts as they might haue) they woulde neuer denie to do it. But leauing this aſide, wee paſſed awaie manie daies there, which laſted vs not ſo long as wee woulde, for the great content that then wee beganne to take in each others companie, which for mine part, I would not haue chaunged for any other mortall delight, and deſire in the whole worlde. In all which time neither Rebecke, nor Bagpipe were heard, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were when other Nymphes came: for when true louers are alone, ſinging (I thinke) and muſicke pleaſeth not their muſing minds ſo much as the mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and looking of one another; and that talking and amorous conuerſation ſhould be more pleaſant and ſweete to them, then the melodie of ſweeteſt muſicke. I cannot tell you by what meanes, but <hi>Delicius</hi> loue to me came to the knowledge of fierce <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> which made him beleeue no leſſe, but that I muſt needs loue him againe, ſince with meeting euerie day, we entertained the time in diſcourſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes: whereupon being not a little enraged, he purpoſed, if <hi>Delicius</hi> deſiſted not from it, to execute his furie vpon him; which he had done indeed, but that he ſtaied his hands (as he ſaid) bicauſe he would not giue me any occaſion of offence, and was Loth to leeſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> &amp; alſo bicauſe indeed he could not know him from his friend
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> leaſt thinking to be reuenged on <hi>Delicius,</hi> he might hurt his friend <hi>Parthenius.</hi> Wherefore to cleere himſelfe of this doubt, one day as <hi>Parthenius,</hi> according to his woonted cuſtome, went where he was, he ſaid vnto him. I vnderſtand my friend
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> that thy brother <hi>Delicius</hi> doth loue
<hi>Stela;</hi> which thing, if it be not more bitter to me then the wilde Olife, I leaue thy iudgement, ſince ſhe is the onely Goddeſſe, to whom my ſoule is ſubiect, and I the onely man that can deſerue her. Of one thing thou maieſt be aſſured, that had it not beene for thy ſake, I would long ſince haue made him leaue ſuch follies, or elſe felt the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my ſheep-hooke. He might haue conſidered, if he had any wit, that he goes about to be a Corriuall with him, who makes no reckoning of the Gods, if there be any at all. Aduiſe him therefore to leaue that to me which is worthily mine owne; if not, tell him that by my iuſtice he ſhall be puniſhed, and not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And bicauſe it is not my will that the great likeneſſe which is betwene you, might preiudice or harme thee, take this ſheepe-hooke, which for ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of a iollie yoong Shepherde, I had of a faire and gracious Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, the which carrying euer in thy handes, I may knowe thee for <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> If thou doſt meane
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> (ſaide <hi>Parthenius</hi>) any harme to
<hi>Delicius</hi> my dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt brother, begin firſt with me, which ſhall I promiſe thee leaſt of both greeue me: But bicauſe thou maieſt knowe they haue not tolde thee true, I ſweare vnto thee by the Gods, whom I adore, and by her, whom I loue more then mine owne life, that <hi>Delicius</hi> loues
<hi>Stela</hi> no more then I do. For her I cannot tell thee, if ſhe loue him or not (and he ſpake in truth in the one and other.) The Sheepehooke thou giueſt me, as an impious gift for ſo vile an effect, I refuſe to take, if by taking it, I thought thou <pb n="285" facs="tcp:23115:145"/>wouldeſt giue it me to the intent to knowe vs one from another. But yet bicauſe I know it is not ſufficient for ſuch a purpoſe, I will take it, bicauſe it ſhall not ſerue thee to that end that thou pretendeſt, when as <hi>Delicius</hi> ſhall carrie it as often as my ſelfe; for by carying it, and not carying it, thou maieſt not knowe which of vs is <hi>Delicius:</hi> whereby thou maieſt cleerely perceiue if his life be deere vnto me or no?
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> was amazed at the great loue that <hi>Parthenius</hi> did beare <hi>Delicius,</hi> but beleeued it was not ſo great in deeds, as in words he ſhewed it: wherefore he anſwered him thus. Behold
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> I haue warned thee nowe for the great friendſhip that is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med between vs: for ſurely I make more account of thee, then thou thinkeſt, bicauſe thou art onely he, by whoſe meanes I finde with imparting my greefe vnto thee, ſome eaſe in theſe my extreme paines. But if with this intent thou wilt take the Sheepehooke of me, I am not content to giue it thee, nor for the woorth of it (for I would giue thee more then this) but bicauſe none of my things ſhoulde come to <hi>Delicius</hi> hands. Of one thing thou maieſt be aſcertained, that loue hath taught me how to know him, and then thou ſhalt ſee, how my deſpiſed counſell ſhall auaile to ſerue him more, then his owne deceitfull opinion. With this
<hi>Parthenius</hi> came away very ſorrowfull and full of melancholike thoughts, not knowing what was beſt to bee done in ſuch a caſe. On the one ſide, he ſawe it was dangerous for <hi>Delicius</hi> to be there; on the other, he knew it was impoſſible for him to abſent himſelf from me. He conceiued by that which he found in himſelfe, the irrepugnable force of
<hi>Cupid,</hi> and conſidered (by that he knew too well) the vnbrideled furie of cruell <hi>Gorphorost.</hi> But if they were deſirous to kill him, they thought it impoſſible, vnleſſe it were by treaſon, which rather then they would haue done, they woulde firſt haue loſt a thouſand liues. That very euening at Sunne ſet, all wee ſower ſitting vnder a leaſie Sallow tree, fierce <hi>Gorphorost</hi> came out of his caue, and by and by was on the top of a high rocke, that hung ouer the riuer, right ouer againſt that place, where I threw my ſelfe into it, when I fled from him. Who after hee had ſit downe a little while, and laid his ſcrip by his ſide, and his Pine tree betweene his legges that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him for his Sheepehooke, ſtaffe, and weapon, he tooke a Flute out of his ſcrip, made of a hundred Baggepipes, ioyned togither with waxe. Putting it to his mouth and blowing it ſtrongly to cleere it of filth within, the hils reſounded againe, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers ranne backe, the wilde beaſts and fiſh were ſtroken in a feare, and the forreſts and woods thereabouts began to tremble. And a little after that, he began to ſing the moſt amorous ſong of me that euer you heard, which I promiſe you had pleaſed me well, if he had not made ſo cruell an ende of it. For with cruell compariſons, borrowed of the fieldes and Shepherds, he ſtrangely praiſed my beautie, and made me (on the contrarie) moſt cruell, by offering mee ſuch things afterwardes as hee thought fitteſt to win me moſt of all vnto him. But to ſee howe he prooued himſelfe faire being ſo fierce, it is a pleaſant ieſt. By that which moſt of all thou loueſt, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> I pray thee faire <hi>Stela</hi> recite it, if thou doſt remember it, which if it like not (perhaps) theſe Gentlemen (a thing different from their eſtate) ſhall woonderfullie delight vs, if they will do vs ſo much pleaſure to lend vs a little patience to heare it, bicauſe it is fitteſt (thou ſaieſt) for countrey Shepherds. No (ſaide Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) but ſhe ſhall do vs as great a pleaſure, to ſee what ſo fierce a Shepherd could ſaie, louing this faire damſell ſo much, whom ſhe hated more. How can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your requeſts, ſaide <hi>Stela,</hi> being ſo brauely coniured? Giue therefore attentiue eare, for I promiſe you it will pleaſe you well.</p>

Stay a little if thou loueſt me (ſaide <hi>Syrenus</hi>) for I cannot but note one <pb n="291" facs="tcp:23115:148"/>thing in this ſong, which hath pleaſed me woonderfull well. And what is it (ſaid <hi>Seluagia</hi>) that makes thee interrupt ſo pleaſant a diſcourſe as this? I will tell you, ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and promiſe you, it will not pleaſe you all: for it inueighed delicately againſt women. How ſo, ſaid <hi>Feliſmena?</hi> I will tell you, anſwered <hi>Syrenus.</hi> For in how many compariſons he fitly made of white and red, gracious, and fine, he neuer made any exception, thinking thereby he greatly honored <hi>Stela,</hi> and that ſhe was glad to be compared to thoſe things: but when he ſaid ſhe was faire, he ſpake that with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kind of reuerence and pardon, ſaying. And if thou doſt not diſdaine it (more faire then a tilled orchard) wherein he thought he offended her, bicauſe in onely being faire, he iudged, that women with their wils would admit no equalitie nor compariſons. But let them ieſt with you in what they will elſe, beautie muſt be a religion not timorouſly touched. And now paſſe on faire <hi>Stela</hi> in thy narration. Euerie one laughed at <hi>Syrenus</hi> words, and Lord <hi>Felix</hi> ſaid. It ſeemes well Shepherd, thou art free, ſince of thy ſelfe thou takeſt leaue to ſay what it pleaſeth thee. To take this ſtrife from you, ſaid
<hi>ſtela,</hi> I will tell on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parthenius</hi> being afraide, as well for the reſolute furie wherewith hee made his threats, as alſo for that which he ſaide to him the ſame morning, not knowing what to do, nor how to inuent a remedie in ſuch an exigent, oftentimes buſied his wits to ſeeke out ſome one or other. But caſting many doubts in ſuch affaires, and thinking with himſelfe what remedie he might finde out for <hi>Delicius</hi> auaile, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what might befall to him, hee reſolued to doe that which you ſhall nowe heare. Staying on a night (as he was woont) for
<hi>Gorphorost,</hi> and being paſſed to the other ſide of the riuer with a merrie and ſmiling countenance, contrarie to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his minde, he ſaide thus vnto him. As I haue beene carefull about thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, ſo knowe friend <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> that I haue perſwaded thy Corriuall to leaue of his loue to <hi>Stela,</hi> the which not able to compaſſe, I haue obtained thus much of him to ſweare to mee to forſake this countrey, and to abſent himſelfe from her. Whereupon hee onely requeſteth but eight daies reſpite for his departure, the which he praied me in his name to craue of thee: So that thou maieſt now well giue me thy Sheepehooke; for heere will I ſtaie alone with thee in theſe parts, and in thy companie. <hi>Gorphorost</hi> being very glad to heare theſe newes that <hi>Parthenius</hi> brought him, thinking that if <hi>Delicius</hi> were gone out of the way, he might the better obtaine his purpoſe and my loue, went by and by for the ſheepehooke, and hauing brought it, gaue it him. Then <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſaid. Behold <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> ſince it is thy will to haue him depart, and me to ſtaie, thou ſhalt ſweare to mee to doe me no harme in the world; &amp; bicauſe thou maiſt vnderſtand that it is I, I haue requeſted the ſheep-hook of thee, the which thou ſhalt continually ſee me carrie about with me: and if thou pretendeſt any other matter, not obſeruing the lawes of holy friendſhip, vnfold to me thy inward thoughts, and I will alſo depart my ſelfe O goe not hence my <hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> anſwered <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> for I ſwear to thee by <hi>Stela</hi> mine only Goddeſſe, that now, nor at any time hereafter, thou ſhalt haue no hurt at my hands, nor by my procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Parthenius</hi> ſatisfied with this agreement &amp; oath, went to put that in practiſe, which he had purpoſed in his minde before (you ſhall hereafter ſee what his intent was hereby) but when he found not
<hi>Crimine,</hi> nor me with <hi>Delicius,</hi> bicauſe we were now gone from him, he kept it till another day, when we were altogither. But as we failed not at our accuſtomed howers, <hi>Parthenius</hi> brought forth the ſheepe-hooke which <hi>Gorphorost</hi> gaue him, the verie ſame that now
<hi>Delicius</hi> hath, and which you did but lately ſee at the fountaine of the Laurell trees, and ſaide. Before I make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt <pb n="292" facs="tcp:23115:149"/>my determination vnto you, I will firſt haue you ſee what a faire gift <hi>Gorphorost</hi> hath giuen me, though his intent was far different from mine: But bicauſe with the reſt, you ſhal alſo heare this, looke vpon it wel, &amp; tel me your opinions, &amp; then I will tell you more. Then we three comming neere togither, bicauſe he had viewed it well before, looked vpon it verie earneſtly, euerie one of vs caſting our eies vpon that which pleaſed vs moſt. We would not haue left looking once and twiſe againe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the curious ſheepe-hooke, although we turned it not a few times about, if we had not a greater deſire to heare what <hi>Parthenius</hi> had promiſed to tell vs. Who, when he ſaw vs expecting what he would ſay, began thus to ſpeake vnto vs. Since the pitifull baniſhment of vs from our deere and natiue countrey is ſufficiently manifeſt vnto you (moſt ſoueraigne Nymphes) and likewiſe the cauſe of our amorous ſtaying in theſe parts, it would ſeeme but time ill ſpent and tedious to make repetition of the ſame againe. I will not ſay that my tarrying here to this preſent time hath beene onely commaunded by the requeſt of my deere
<hi>Delicius,</hi> for that your ſweete com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and ſight was ſufficient to haue forcibly detained here a worthier perſon then my ſelfe. But that which I minde to tell you is, that as to this hower my being here hath beene perhaps conuenient; ſo from this day forward my departure is needfull, and in ſuch ſort that (all affection laid aſide) you would iudge there is no other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing for our auayle. Whereof bicauſe you may not be in ſuſpence, and of my late determination, if with attention you will giue eare vnto me, the inexcuſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of my intended departure ſhal be cleerly known vnto you. You are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt of the odde and inconuenient loue of fierce <hi>Gorphorost</hi> with thee faire <hi>Stela,</hi> nor of the euen and proportionable loue, or of the ſound (to ſay better) and perfect affection of <hi>Delicius</hi> with thee againe faire <hi>Stela.</hi> But loue that diſcouers all things, hath ſuggeſted into the fierce Shepherds eares (as by his ſong you might well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue) that he hath for riuall (if it may be ſo ſaide) my deere brother. If he grieued thereat, your ſelues haue heard him ſing it on the top of yonder rocke: and being in his company that ſame morning before, I heard it from his owne mouth, where he ſaid vnto me, that he purpoſed to be reuenged on him, and onely for the great loue and friendſhip he bare me, proteſted that he deferred the ſame. But now not able to ſuffer it any longer, and not knowing by what meanes to be auenged of his aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, without executing the puniſhment on me, for the great likenes betweene vs, and for auoiding the harme that might come thereof, he gaue me this ſheep-hooke, bicauſe by carrying it, he might know me from him, the which for that it was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me for a cruell act, I then refuſed: but afterwards ſeeing his great rage, by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying out a good meanes for both our auailes, I tooke it. And this was my deuiſe, I told him that
<hi>Delicius</hi> by my counſell and perſwaſion would go his waies; ſo that he might giue me the ſheep-hooke, whereby he might know that I remained ſtill in this countrey. For which departure I craued eight daies reſpit, which he willingly graunted me. Now therefore it behooues me to go ſeeke out my Father, with whom or without him, within a certaine time I will returne hither againe, where <hi>Delicius</hi> in the meane time may ſtay in my place, and viſite <hi>Gorphorost</hi> in my name to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the better with him; whom before I will aduiſe, and acquainte with all that I haue paſſed with him, becauſe hee may thinke it is I. This did
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> ſaie with ill vttered wordes, for the greefe of taking his leaue of <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> and mee, whome hee loued ſo much, woulde not let him frame them any better. None of vs three had then the courage, to anſwere any thing to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> wounding wordes, for the great greefe that wee conceiued of his ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <pb n="293" facs="tcp:23115:149"/>departure: but after wee had all helde our peace a good while, <hi>Crimine</hi> with watred eies (for then ſhe had not the power to diſſemble the great loue ſhe bare him any longer) ſaide. It is now no time, my friend <hi>Parthenius,</hi> by my forced countenance to diſſemble the inward paine and greefe of my hart, if hitherto by deedes and demonſtrations thou wilt not vnderſtand and ſee how much I loue thee, by wordes therefore at this preſent let it be cleere vnto thee, That I loue thee, and louing thee more then mine owne life, determine to goe in thy companie (at the leſt with thy conſent) if thou wilt not carie me with thee, or elſe with mine owne hands (if not with thine thou wilt not) reſolue to giue me my mortall ſtroke of death, which ſhall be more glorious and acceptable to me, then giuen by my ſelfe when thou art gone. Then ſhe being as it were cut off from her boldnes, with a tainted bluſh and a ſorrowfull ſigh, held her peace. To whoſe amorous wordes
<hi>Parthenius</hi> wiſely anſwered thus. <hi>Stela</hi> had ſcarce begun
<hi>Parthenius</hi> anſwere, when <hi>Felicia</hi> with the companie ſhe brought with her came, ſaying to <hi>Feliſmena.</hi> Doſt thou not thinke that I haue fulfilled that which I promiſed thee yeſterday, by comming hither to day at the woorſt time? Yes indeede good Lady, ſaide
<hi>Feliſmena.</hi> But why muſt we pay for that, ſaide
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> which ſhe hath eaten: bicauſe we muſt pay her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for her companie, ſaide <hi>Felicia.</hi> But more for your ſakes then <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> I will be gone, for I came to no other purpoſe but to accompliſh my word, and hereupon ſhe went, they remaining ſtill that were there before. Then <hi>Stela</hi> ſaid.</p>
               <p>But harke what <hi>Parthenius</hi> anſwered to
<hi>Crimines</hi> words. I am not able to iudge, deere Nymph, if thy ill fortune be greater by hauing placed thy loue in ſo miſerable a man; or my miſhap greater, by nothauing libertie to giue thee the like againe. On the one ſide I would gladly ſatisfie thy deſire, and haue on the other no power to doe it: yet I will not denie to doe thee this pleaſure to carie thee with me, whereby I ſhould not gaine little, if I thought not to doe faire
<hi>Stela,</hi> and my brother <hi>Delicius</hi> an ill turne: her, by bereauing her of ſo ſweete companion; him, by depriuing him of her, by whoſe meanes he hopes to be remedied, whereas thou knoweſt how ill it would fall out for him with thy faire companion when thou art abſent. I was not a little glad to heare him with ſuch modeſtie take an occaſion to forſake
<hi>Crimine,</hi> bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my life moleſted with the ſecret iealouſie I had of <hi>Crimine,</hi> depended (me thought) vpon his anſwere to her againe. And ſo turning to <hi>Parthenius,</hi> I ſaide. For mine owne part, good Shepherd, I thanke thee for thy good will thou haſt to doe me ſo much honour, by not conſenting to carie away with thee my friend <hi>Crimine:</hi> But for that which I owe her, and wherein I am bound to thee, and for the content of both, I agree thereunto, though it be to mine owne coſt: wherefore denie not what ſhe hath with ſuch earneſt affection requeſted. But before thou anſwere me to this, I muſt needes tell thee that (it ſeemes) thou haſt taken more leaue, bicauſe thou art going away, then was reſerued, by taking ſo boldly vpon thee to ſpeake for thy friend
<hi>Delicius</hi> beyond the due limits of chaſtitie, and common friendſhip, which were promiſed me. But I will pardon thee, as I ſaid, bicauſe thou art now but a gheſt, who are allowed to doe and ſay what they liſt. But yet I would faine knowe who it is that hath taken thy libertie from thee, as thou ſaieſt, no doubt the onely impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make thee condeſcend to the amorous requeſt of my friend <hi>Crimine.</hi> If thou thinkeſt (ſaide <hi>Parthenius</hi>) to haue me ſo obedient to thee as my friend <hi>Delicius,</hi> by ſatisfying all thy demaunds (pardon me faire Nymph) thou art much deceiued. This ſelfeſame thing didſt thou aske him, which coſt vs all deere, how much more then hauing no cauſe to aske it, when it can ſerue thee to no purpoſe. One thing thou <pb n="294" facs="tcp:23115:150"/>maiſt know, that ſomething thou muſt not know. To that which thou replieſt to me of gracious <hi>Crimine,</hi> I haue now anſwered.
<hi>Crimine</hi> not able to ſuffer theſe wordes any longer, with teares trickling downe her cheekes, and without ſpeaking a worde went her waies.
<hi>Delicius</hi> went after her to comfort her, and telling her that
<hi>Parthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> was not yet going, promiſed to requite the good turne in like manner as ſhe had done to him, by regaining <hi>Stelas</hi> loſt fauour: with hope whereof being ſomthing cheered vp, ſhe went her waies. And in the meane time I ſaide thus to <hi>Parthenius.</hi> How faine would I
<hi>(Parthenius)</hi> not haue thee go thy waies, and as greatly deſire that
<hi>Crimines</hi> teares would not mooue thee. For the firſt I thinke there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (ſaid he) bicauſe I deſire it more then any can imagine: and for the ſecond thou needeſt take no care, in that thou commandeſt and I muſt obey. I knowe thou wilt not go (ſaide I) without ſpeaking to me. No, anſwered <hi>Parthenius,</hi> for that were not poſſible. Why then God be with thee ſaid I, for I cannot leaue my companie. And with thee, faire Nymph, ſaide he. Stay a little ſaide <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> for I muſt needs tell thee, that (in faith) thou didſt <hi>Delicius</hi> great iniury by neuer fauouring him halfe ſo much, as thou didſt <hi>Parthenius</hi> at that time; whereupon thou wert enclined (it ſeemes) more to him, then to
<hi>Delicius.</hi> Impatient iealouſie was the cauſe heerof, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Stela:</hi> But harken on, for I was not heerein one whit behinde hande with <hi>Delicius,</hi> who deſerued much, bicauſe by a moſt amorous paſſage which enſued, he ſhewed an euident proofe of loue and humilitie: For after I had taken my leaue of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and going ſomewhat in haſte to ouertake <hi>Crimine,</hi> I met <hi>Delicius</hi> by the way, comming backe from accompanying her: who when a pretie way off he eſpied me in ſuch haſte, before I came to him, ſaide. If I may not offend thee, I beſeech thee, (ſoueraigne Miſtreſſe) when thou commeſt nigh mee, not to paſſe by in ſuch haſte, bicauſe I may thinke that thou flieſt not from me, if not, thy will be done. Truelie ſaide all of them, it was highly conſidered of him, who well deſerued to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but let vs heare what thou didſt anſwere, or do in hearing theſe words. With a ſoft and ſlowe pace, ſaide <hi>Stela,</hi> I came to him ſaying. Thy requeſt, being ſo reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and modeſt, I cannot chuſe but grant, as all ſuch beſides, that ſauour of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and honeſt meaning (touching thy ſelfe) I will neuer diſobey, and will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go ſoftly bie, but ſtaie with thee as much as thou pleaſeſt, ſo that I may conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ouertake <hi>Crimine.</hi> I ſpake all this of purpoſe, for as he iudged (perhaps) that I ſhewed <hi>Parthenius</hi> loue, by the words which I vttered when I departed from him, (wherein I would not haue preferred him before <hi>Delicius,</hi> ſince in loue and affection I did not) I therefore endeuoured to make him not imagine any ſuch matter at all. Who in his owne iudgement not able to requite ſo great a fauour, fell preſently downe on his knees (though I did the beſt I coulde to hinder him) and taking my hand betweene both his, with great humilitie kiſſed it. Maruelling at ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den part, and knowing that ſuch preſumption proceeded of deepe loue, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I ſaid vnto him. Though for this bold attempt thou deſerueſt puniſhment, yet I will not giue it thee, bicauſe I will not giue thy brother an occaſion to be offended with me, by ſaying that I can pardon nothing. <hi>Delicius</hi> came to himſelfe again, &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his boldnes had put him in no ſmal hazard to leeſe me, he had ſuch a colour for ſhame and feare, that it did not a little augment his braue beautie, which I noted too well. Wherefore to encourage him, I ſaid. Art thou content? <hi>Delicius</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. O my ſweere Miſtreſſe, I, but that I cannot thanke thee ſo much as I would, and with this I will ſtaie thee no more. Both of vs being gone from one another, I made haſte after <hi>Crimine,</hi> and he to <hi>Parthenius,</hi> who paſſed many ſweete and amorous ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <pb n="295" facs="tcp:23115:150"/>togither vpon his friends departure, bicauſe <hi>Delicius</hi> would not conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but when he perceiued that he woulde needes go (by reaſon of the imminent danger that they were both in, if he had ſtaied longer then the time prefixed) he would not alſo agree vnto his departure without his companie: But in the end being ouercome by <hi>Parthenius,</hi> though much againſt his will, he yeelded to his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this meane while, beleeue not Gentlemen, that we were idle on the other ſide, for we were thinking of
<hi>Parthenius</hi> bitter departure, <hi>Crimine</hi> complaining ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before me of his cold affection; and ſometimes comforting herſelfe with
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licius</hi> promiſe, with which ſpeeches and imaginations we went to bed. The hower being now come, when all mortall creatures take reſt, and
<hi>Crimine</hi> lying by her ſelfe ſole, and ſolitarie to her owne thoughts, what ſhe ſuffered and talked ſoftly to her ſelfe, I know not, but what I paſſed, my ſelfe can tell you. For thinking that my bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow was aſleepe, and the candles being put out, and alſo the ſilent darkenes of the night (a faithfull friend to thoughts and fanſies) ſeruing my minde ſo fitly, diuers and ſundrie things were repreſented to it, which being well grounded in my breaſt, I began thus to ſay to my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>What God hath brought theſe two new Shepherds into theſe parts, to make ſuch an alteration in me? What, am not I ſhe, whom the onely thought of a man was woont to offend? What great content then doth the thinking of theſe two yoong Shepherdes giue me? Am I not ſhee, who delighted ſo much in hunting of beaſts and birds: Why do I then hunt now after thoughts and vanities? Am I not ſhe, that of mine owne free minde offered my ſelfe vp to <hi>Dianas</hi> ſeruice? Why with my will then muſt I become a bond-maide to <hi>Venus?</hi> Hence hence from me ſuch an vnſeemely fault. O pardon me <hi>Delicius,</hi> and <hi>Parthenius,</hi> for yet I cannot chooſe, but do that which you both deſerue. O Gods, what a virgin colour is in their yoong and ſweete faces, adorned with that little haire vpon their vermillion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cheekes, what beautie, what mildneſſe, what diſcretion? I thinke truely they muſt deſcende from ſome linage of the Gods, if they bee not ſuch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, wherein my ſurmiſe (I knowe) is not vaine. The God <hi>Hymen</hi> not beeing hatefull to mee, I coulde perhappes ſubmit my ſelfe to this onely fault. But I beſeech the Gods, the earth may firſt ſwallowe mee vp, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> with his thunderbolt ſmite me to the mournfull ſhades of <hi>Acheron,</hi> and perpetuall night, before I violate thee (O chaſtitie) or breake thy holy bondes. The chaſte minde that euer I haue borne, ſhall accompanie me to my graue. But I know, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends me not by thinking to which of both I ſhoulde encline, if my firme intent ſhould turn to any ſide? which of them both excels the other in diſpoſition, feature, and beautie, to loue the one more for that, and forſake the other for this I cannot diſcerne; who are ſo like, that if they themſelues beheld one another, they could not knowe the one from the other. Great is the goodnes of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> for euen to the hazard of his life he offered it for ſafetie of his friend. What wittie and readie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres for <hi>Delicius?</hi> What wiſedome to make my companion helpe his, and me not to forſake him, and that fierce
<hi>Gorphorost</hi> might not hurt him? <hi>Parthenius</hi> in the end deſerued well my loue, but yet (I thinke) he goes not beyond
<hi>Delicius,</hi> who needed not the fauour of his brother to helpe him, and could no doubt haue done no leſſe then he. And though he neuer had occaſion to ſhew the ſharpnes of his wit, his pithie wordes, and wittie anſweres (from the which he was cut off from the very beginning) yet how cleerely by all his ſweete ſongs and ditties that he made, did he manifeſt it? What verſes did he carue in the tree, or rather in my hart, how modeſt, <pb n="296" facs="tcp:23115:151"/>by refraining (not to offend me) to ſpeake of that, which concerned him moſt. O God, and what great reaſon haue I then to loue him? But who beleeues not that <hi>Parthenius,</hi> if he had alſo loued me, would not haue done as much. Alas then for me, to whether of them ſhall I incline? Muſt <hi>Delicius</hi> be deſpiſed, bicauſe he loues me, and for deſiring ſo much my loue againe? Muſt I conſent that he die, bicauſe he deſireth to liue with me? Muſt he be guerdoned with vnworthy death for ſo high a deſert of his great loue? O hapleſſe
<hi>Delicius,</hi> I would I had neuer ſeene thee, or thou not caſt thine eies vpon me? Thou well deſerueſt my loue, if I had not vowed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie, and if my importunate deſtinies had not threatened me with marriage. But muſt <hi>Parthenius</hi> be reiected bicauſe he loues me not as
<hi>Delicius</hi> doth? For this he is more woorthie to be admitted into my loue. It imports but little that he loue mee not, ſo I loue him that hath ſo many good parts in him woorthy to be beloued. That which moſt of all forceth me to his loue, is that I cannot ſuffer with patience that
<hi>Crimine</hi> ſhould loue him. But whither do I range in theſe wandring thoughts? what need I take ſuch care for them, after ſo many whom I haue deſpiſed? Why doe I thus torment my ſelfe? Their beautie mooues me not (and yet the ſame might well do it) who are but yet boies. They themſelues mooue me not, but their yong and flouriſhing youth. But let them go hence in a good hower, now that of mine owne free will I haue counſelled them, and the rather ſince marriage is denied mee. Let them go, and ſeeke forth ſome other loues, ſince none that are wiſe will reiect them. But alas for me this leaue is too harde. With theſe laſt words, not able to paſſe on further, though many other things remained ſtill in my minde, I held my peace, my toong was ſilent, but my hart did ſtill ſpeake. And with theſe and like wordes and praiſes (poore ſoule) without knowing what I did, and rude in ſuch affaires, I loued without the ſence of loue: I conceiued the fire without ſeeing it, and nouriſhed a wound in my vaines without feeling it. Three or fower daies paſſed, in the which we went not to the Shepherds, bicauſe <hi>Crimine</hi> came not foorth, for ſeeing herſelfe diſdained of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> ſhe endeuoured to forget him by her abſence, which kindled her fire the more. So that I would haue beene now glad, that <hi>Parthenius</hi> had loued <hi>Crimine</hi> in lieu of ſeeing him and <hi>Delicius.</hi> For the which I many times importuned her, that we might go ſee them, by putting her in mind of the hope that
<hi>Delicius</hi> had giuen her: but for all this ſhe forced herſelfe not to come before him. There remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned now but two daies to come of the time prefixed for <hi>Parthenius</hi> departure, when, not able to endure ſo long an abſence, I ſpake thus vnto her. It might not a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice me (deere ſiſter) if we went to ſee the Shepherds, bicauſe I promiſed to ſpeake with <hi>Parthenius</hi> before he went. <hi>Crimine</hi> deſiring the ſame no leſſe then I (as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) anſwered me ſaying. Thou maieſt go good friend, although I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, that I deſire to ſee mine enimie. But this hapleſſe loue is ſo cruell, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe in the end but tell thee the truth, that my going this time will auaile me as little (I know) as other times before. Behold thou canſt not tell
<hi>Crimine</hi> (ſaide I) what <hi>Delicius</hi> hath done for thee, in recompence of the good turne he owes thee, &amp; for the promiſe he made thee: and if this were not ſo, remember that certaine daies paſt, my ſelfe hauing leſſe occaſion and will to go, yet onely to content thee I went thither. So that thou art bounde now to performe my requeſt, when I was then ſo willing to do thy command. Thou haſt ouercommed ſaide ſhe, I will nor cannot gainſay thy forcible reaſons. Whereupon we went to the Shepherds, whom when I eſpied gone aſide (for on purpoſe they were talking very earneſtly togither) I ſaide to my companion. They ſhould now talke of ſome great matters, and it may bee <pb n="297" facs="tcp:23115:151"/>
                  <hi>Delicius</hi> is talking about thy affaires. Nay about thine, anſwered ſhe againe. And it was true indeed. For both of them were in counſell togither, as afterwards we knew it. Being come to the Shepherds, we found ſuch an alteration in them, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med very ſtrange to vs. What will you more, but that <hi>Delicius</hi> ſeemed to haue changed the loue that he did beare me, to beſtow it on <hi>Crimine,</hi> when he had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt reaſon to loue me. Who, at the laſt time when I ſpake to him, got more of me then euer he did before. I coulde not by any meanes know the cauſe of this ſudden change. Truth it is, that as I had perceiued
<hi>Delicius</hi> loue to <hi>Crimine</hi> to be but colde, as that I alſo held him for ſuch an one, who would not change without great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not able to coniecture it by any fault of mine owne, I haue ſuſpected, and
<hi>Crimine</hi> thinkes no leſſe, but that <hi>Delicius</hi> by ſome waies ſhould know of <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſecret loue to me; and by ſayning that he had forgot mee, it was to giue place to his deere friend in my loue. Which if it be ſo (as we beleeue) although we could neuer get it of him, it is (Gentlemen) one of the nobleſt deeds of friendſhip that was euer ſeene to this day. For in more then a whole yeere that we accompanied togither, he neuer ſolicited me for himſelfe, but for his friende, beholding me euer with ſuch modeſtie, as if we had beene both borne in one bellie. But I pray thee tell vs (ſaid <hi>Doria</hi>) what meanes he vſed to ſhew that he did not loue thee. That I will, ſaid <hi>Stela,</hi> bicauſe there remaines now but litle of my tale, for our long peregrination with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny misfortunes that we haue paſſed ſhal be kept for ſome fitter time: When we were come before the Shepherds, <hi>Delicius</hi> ſhewed a certaine kinde of greater libertie and boldnes in his words, and more merrines in his countenance then he was woont to do. Whereat both of vs maruelling not a little, and asking him the cauſe, he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Times are not euer all one, nor equall <hi>Stela.</hi> The fire many times mollifies that which is harde. The fineſt plaiſter (be it neuer ſo well tempered) if it be too much charged, fals downe againe. So much water may be caſt on the greateſt fire, that it will put it quite out. My great loue ſerued me nothing at all to make thee gentle, and thy extreme diſdaine hath auailed me to make me forget thee. I had grounded well mine affection on thee, but thou haſt choaked it with a multitude of torments, ſorrowes, &amp; cares. Great was the flame that burned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in my breſt, but thou haſt quenched it with exceſſiue water of thy cold disfauours, &amp; with th'abundance of my teares. So that from this day thou maieſt well match thee with one, who is more vertuous, wiſe, &amp; conſtant then I am, &amp; who may in iuſt proportion bee more anſwerable to thee in euery thing then my ſelfe; for I confeſſe I am not ſufficient for it. Yet I will not denie, but that I am now as truely, and as much deuoted to thy ſeruice as euer I was before, whereof thou maieſt make triall, if it pleaſe thee in whatſoeuer thou wilt command mee, though in another kinde of reſpect then in theſe daies paſt. We were all three looking with what libertie he tooke his leaue of my loue, and maruelled more at his change. <hi>Delicius</hi> had tolde <hi>Parthenius</hi> before of his determination, but he neuer beleeued all till then, when he verily thought his companion did not loue me, bicauſe face to face ſo conſtantly he tolde mee it, thinking if it had beene otherwiſe, it had not beene poſſible for him to haue vſed the boldeneſſe nor courage by ſpeaking to me in ſuch ſorte. At this noueltie I ſtoode aſtoniſhed, and a certaine kind of remorſe and repentance (me thought) troubled mee for handling him, and mine owne matters ſo ill: but diſſembling it as well as I coulde, I ſaide. O howe glad am I to heare theſe good wordes Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd? From this time forwarde I will loue thee more then euer I did. But I know not (ſaid <hi>Crimine</hi>) what I may ſay vnto thee friend <hi>Delicius,</hi> neither can I ſound
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:23115:152"/>the cauſe of ſuch a ſudden alteration. Tell me if thou haſt any occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of <hi>Stela?</hi> For heere I will cauſe her to make thee amends without the conſent of ſuch a breach. The Gods be contrarie to me in all my deſires, ſaide <hi>Delicius,</hi> if I haue any iuſt complaint of her, but onely of my hap. And by them I ſweare vnto thee, that I do this, bicauſe I finde it moſt expedient for me. Wherefore if thou deſireſt my good, thou ſhouldſt not ſpeake to me about it. In faith <hi>Crimine,</hi> ſaid I, thou art verie pleaſant, how long I pray you, had you leaue to trouble your ſelfe with my mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and ſuch as like me not at all. Bicauſe it ſhould like thee wel, ſaid
<hi>Crimine,</hi> I ſpake it. If ſuch things liked me well, ſaid I, ſmiling, there is <hi>Parthenius,</hi> who hath no leſſe good parts in him to be loued then his friend, if they haue not both (perhaps) agreed togither about this matter. This did I ſpeake but in ieſt, but loue did not ieſt with me at all. I would not make this agreement, ſaid
<hi>Delicius,</hi> if it were not for that, which I loue moſt in this life, which I wiſh thou wouldſt loue, leauing him to ſaile with the greateſt proſperitie in the ſeas of thy happie loue. <hi>Delicius</hi> laboured ſo much in the end, by ſhewing himſelfe alſo ſo appaſſionate for
<hi>Crimine</hi> (but truely but now) that <hi>Parthenius</hi> diſcouered himſelfe the next day to be my open louer, and for <hi>Delicius</hi> his ſake had kept it ſo long cloſe, which was the cauſe (he ſaid) why he could neuer be mooued to loue <hi>Crimine.</hi> I had not then beene a little proud and glad, as I ſhould be now, if I had then knowen, or did now know, that I was equally beloued of them both, as I loue them both alike.
<hi>Crimine</hi> had no end of her ioy and content, thinking that ſhe was in good earneſt beloued of <hi>Delicius,</hi> the which he cunningly ſhewed by words and deeds. But now ſhe is not I thinke in ſuch glorie and content bicauſe he is as cold in her loue again, although he euer makes her ſome ſhew thereof. The laſt day of reſpit, wherein <hi>Parthenius</hi> was to depart, was now come, when the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Delicius</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Parthenius.</hi> Since it is thy will (deere brother) to abſent thy ſelfe from me (a hard and heauie chaunce) it ſhall be needfull for me to goe to morrow to <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> and ſpeake to him in thy behalfe, bicauſe with the inſtructions that thou haſt giuen me I may know from henceforth how to conuerſe with him, and as thou ſhalt afterwards aduiſe me how I may entertaine his company. It may be he will keepe me till night: Thinke not therefore much if I ſtay ſo long. This agreement
<hi>Delicius</hi> made with <hi>Parthenius,</hi> bicauſe he had now determined to goe and ſeeke out his parents, and to leaue <hi>Parthenius</hi> with me, for he neuer meant to goe ſeeke out <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> nor to ſpeake with him at all; but onely to abſent himſelfe ſecretly, as afterwards he informed vs of it. He knew, or at the leaſt ſuſpected that
<hi>Parthenius</hi> would not conſent to haue him goe without him, and therefore thought it good to vſe this diſſimulation, bicauſe he would not haue him nor vs paſſe the hard traunce of his greeuous departure. Hereupon he went towards the riuer, and neere to the place, where he was wont to ſtay for <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> wrote this with a knife in an Elme, in letters that might be diſcerned a good way off.</p>
               <p>My deere friende <hi>Parthenius,</hi> thou ſhalt feele by thy ſelfe, if thy abſence will not breede an extreme ſorrow in me; but bicauſe this is forced and neceſſarie, I thinke it beſt for thee to tarie ſtill, ſince thou haſt ſo great reaſon for it. That which I commende to thy charge (for the friendſhip betweene vs both) is to make no change of place nor of thy faire yoong Shepherdeſſe, for this ſhall be the greateſt pleaſure that thou maiſt doe me. And as for the reſt, I promiſe thee to ſeeke out my father and thy mother with all diligence, carying ſo good tokens with me as I doe of them both. Within a yeere (if the Gods ſpare me life and health) I will returne and viſit thee, with report of that which I haue done, and hath befallen vnto me. I <pb n="299" facs="tcp:23115:152"/>pray thee once againe not to depart from hence. For if thou thinkeſt to ſeeke me, perhaps thou ſhalt leeſe me, bicauſe comming backe againe, I ſhall not knowe where thou art. The Sheepehooke thou ſhalt finde at the foote of this Elme hidden vnder the ſandes. The Gods remaine with thee and accompany me.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Crimine</hi> and I, knowing that <hi>Parthenius</hi> was to goe that day away, went in the morning betimes to take our leaues of him (or to ſay more truly) for <hi>Crimine</hi> to intreate him in my behalfe, for ſhe had ſome ſuſpition of me, that I was affected to him) who meant not to abſent himſelfe, but that ſince they could not be there both together for the cauſes aboueſaid, one of them ſhould goe to ſome neere place thereabouts, and come thither by turnes, the one going and the other comming in courſe; and that thus by the abſence of either, <hi>Gorphorost</hi> might be deceiued by the Sheepehooke. But when we were now come before
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> and ſawe him all alone, we asked him for
<hi>Delicius,</hi> who tolde vs that he was gone to <hi>Gorphorost</hi> to learne to keepe him companie after he was gone. Which when <hi>Crimine</hi> heard, without tarying any longer ſhe went to attend her new loue, where ſhe knew <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> was accuſtomed to goe, who taried with me walking vp and downe in a little greene meadow within the forreſt.
<hi>Crimine</hi> comming to the Elme, ſawe what <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> had grauen ſo lightly in it, and reading it, not able to endure any longer with patience, ſhe began to weepe, and crie out alowde, accurſing her misfortune, and as ſhe determined to follow him, ſhe firſt thought good to tell <hi>Parthenius</hi> of it. But going to take out the Sheepehooke,
<hi>Gorphoroſt</hi> from a high hill eſpied <hi>Parthenius</hi> and me, and how all alone hand in hand we walked vp and downe, and ſeeing him without the Sheepehooke, thought ſurely it was <hi>Delicius.</hi> Whereupon he began to crie out alowd, and with ſuch furie as he made the earth to ſhake, ſaying. Now haue I eſpied thee wicked Impe, which I will make thy laſt ſight and delight, and then with an incredible ſwiftnes he came downe from thence, and in an inſtant paſſed ouer the riuer. I being fearefull with the terrible voice, and warned of the Nymphes watchword got me to the riuer.
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> fearing more the harme that might haue befallen to his friend, then his owne danger, ſtaied for him without flying away, which though he would haue done he could not, bicauſe <hi>Gorphorost</hi> was ſo neere. <hi>Crimine</hi> hearing the furious voice of <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> ſuſpecting what might happen, like a wiſe woman (for ſurely ſhe is no leſſe) came running to the place where ſhe had left vs, to warne
<hi>Gorphoroſt</hi> in time that it was his friend <hi>Parthenius,</hi> leaſt being decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he might haue done him ſome harme. And beleeue me, Gentlemen, with her maſtered wiſedome, ſhe reſtored to vs all our liues: So that ſhe came to <hi>Parthenius</hi> (for I was now gone) and ſtept before <hi>Gorphoroſt,</hi> ſaying. Stay <hi>Gorphoroſt,</hi> and behold him well: for this is <hi>Parthenius,</hi> and bicauſe thou maiſt thinke it is true, behold heere the Sheepehooke which thou didſt giue him, for ſhe had taken it out of the place where <hi>Delicius</hi> had hidden it. Whereupon being ſomewhat pacified, although not wholly pleaſed bicauſe he ſaw vs walke hand in hand, and not aſſured who he was, he tooke him, ſaying to <hi>Crimine.</hi> I will be better aduiſed who he is, and accordingly will do with him what it pleaſeth me. And ſaying thus, he tooke vp <hi>Parthenius</hi> vnder his arme, and ranne away with him as faſt as he could. <hi>Parthenius</hi> durſt not aske <hi>Crimine</hi> for
<hi>Delicius,</hi> although he ſaw the Sheep-hooke, which he carried away with him that morning, bicauſe he thought he was with <hi>Gorphorost.</hi> For if he asked for him, he had then giuen him to vnderſtand that he was
<hi>Parthenius.</hi> So that he would haue rather ſuffered, ſaying he was
<hi>Delicius</hi> then not, leaſt any harm might haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to
<hi>Delicius</hi> by confeſſing himſelfe to be <hi>Parthenius.</hi> With this incertainty <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoroſt</hi> 
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:23115:153"/>caſt him into a darke caue, to the mouth whereof he rouled a great peece of a rocke inſteed of a doore, as afterwards we knew it. <hi>Crimine</hi> with that content and ſorrow as you may imagine, knowing <hi>Delicius</hi> was gone, and ſeeing
<hi>Parthenius</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away in that ſort, came to our manſions to bring me newes of what had paſſed, and to tell me what ſhe had reſolued to do. When ſhe came into our withdrawing chamber, ſhe found me almoſt breathles: for I was reuoluing in my thoughts what had happened to me concerning both my loues. When I ſaw her, I roſe vp from my bed, where I had laid me downe, and going towards her (my breaſt bathed in teares, and my haire torne with my handes) I caſt mine armes about her necke, not able to ſpeake a word, but gaue a ſorrowfull ſigh, which I fetcht out from the profoundeſt part of my amorous ſoule. <hi>Crimine</hi> with a little more force then I had, holding faſt by me, as well as ſhe could, came to the bed, and there fell downe with me vpon it, where we lay a good while without ſpeaking or moouing. We were not ſeene in theſe trances of the other Nymphes, bicauſe they were moſt of them gone to ſolace themſelues along the riuer banks. After a little time therefore, as I began againe to rent my clothes that couered my breaſt, marking my tender fleſh with my hard nailes, <hi>Crimine,</hi> awaked as it were out of a dreame, helde my pitileſſe (or rather more pitifull) hands. To whom at laſt I ſaid. Let my hands alone, <hi>Crimine,</hi> for they do no more then they are bound to do. For thinking perhaps to be pitifull, be not in lieu thereof ſo cruell vnto me. Let them pull out my hart to be openly knowen, for that hitherto it hath beene euer ſecret. O <hi>Stela,</hi> O <hi>Parthenius,</hi> O
<hi>Delicius.</hi> Hearken to me, ſaid <hi>Crimine,</hi> if thou wilt haue me lighten thy greefes, and augment mine owne paſſion. <hi>Parthenius</hi> is ſafe by my meanes, and <hi>Delicius</hi> loſt for thy ſake. Doſt thou affirme that to be true, ſaid I. Is <hi>Delicius</hi> dead? Loſt, I haue ſaid, not dead, ſaid <hi>Crimine?</hi> for what doſt thou call loſt, ſaide I? To me (anſwered ſhe) for thy ſake, bicauſe to leaue
<hi>Parthenius</hi> to thee, he hath taken that iourney in hand, which
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenius</hi> was about to do, to ſeeke out his parents. Then ſomewhat appeaſed, I asked her farther, how ſhe knew it, which ſhe told me in order as it was; affirming after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards how ſhe had reſolued to follow
<hi>Delicius.</hi> Haſt thou ſuch courage, ſaid I, as that thou dareſt alone take vpon thee ſuch a dangerous iourney. I will not goe alone, ſaid ſhe, for loue ſhall accompanie me which is afraide of nothing. Being ſtung with the pricke of iealouſie, and not able to ſuffer, that ſhe ſhould goe alone with one whom I loued more then my ſelfe, I ſaid. Since thou haſt ſo good a defence with thee, I will alſo accompany thee. But let vs firſt (I beſeech thee) endeuour to know, what is become of
<hi>Parthenius;</hi> for if he be dead, I will not liue, nor come before
<hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> with ſuch vnfortunate newes, being aſſured that whoſoeuer ſhall firſt aduertiſe him thereof, ſhall giue him no leſſe then death. Whom we ſhould rather informe (as ſoone as might be) if he were priſoner, to ſeeke out ſome meanes to deliuer him from thence, which counſell we thought was the beſt. We remained therefore in this determination, and ſuch was our good hap, that walking the ſecond day vp and downe the riuer bankes, at the narroweſt place of it there came a ſtrong and luſtie Shepherdeſſe with a ſling in her hand, and being right ouer againſt vs, did fling ouer to our ſide a certaine thing like a round ball, and then running away as faſt as ſhee could, got her into the Iland before her. We not coniecturing what that might meane, and deſirous to know what it was, went to take it vp, that ran trendling in the meadow before vs. When we had it into our hands, we ſaw it was a peece of linnen tyed vp faſt togither, and within it a round ſtone, which we thought was put in, leaſt with the lightnes of the linnen, it had fallen into the riuer. This peece of linnen was <pb n="301" facs="tcp:23115:153"/>written all ouer, and I thinke with the iuice of Mulberies, for it ſeemed he wanted inke and paper, looking vpon the letter we knew it to be the hande of <hi>Parthenius,</hi> wherby he willed vs to be of good comfort, &amp; told vs the order of his impriſonment, and how by the tokens which he gaue <hi>Gorphorost,</hi> he was now ſufficiently reſolued, that he was not <hi>Delicius,</hi> and that he vſed him verie well, but would nor dimiſſe him, bicauſe he kept him for a baite for
<hi>Delicius,</hi> knowing that it might auaile him for the great friendſhip that was betweene them; and alſo bicauſe if he did let him goe, he might take <hi>Delicius</hi> (if afterwards he met him) for <hi>Parthenius,</hi> of whom he might not be deceiued if he kept him ſtill in his caue. And therefore becauſe <hi>Delicius</hi> might not come in ſight by any meanes, ſaid, that he would take ſome order himſelfe for his owne deliuerie. With theſe doubtfull newes, and happie aduenture we went to ſeeke out <hi>Delicius.</hi> And truely if we had not carryed that peece of linnen cloth writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by
<hi>Parthenius</hi> owne hand to him, the griefe of the impriſonment of his deere brother had made an end of him by reaſon of the great ſorrow that he felt thereof, as yet he doth, as you daily ſee.</p>
               <p>Behold heere therefore Gentlemen, what you deſired to know of the Shepherd and vs, and for what cauſe we go vp and downe in his company. And the reaſon why my father woulde haue killed him, I ſuſpect to be this, That the Nymphes our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes (ſeeing vs all fower waiting at one time) tolde him (perhaps) that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds had carried vs away with them: So that we founde out this yoong Shepherd with whom we go, and the infinite troubles that we haue ſuffered, and muſt ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, vntill we ſee
<hi>Parthenius</hi> ſo well beloued of vs all three. Wherefore I pray you do me this fauour, to requeſt no more of me at this time, nor howe we founde him out, vntill with more ioy we be altogither, if our misfortunes ſhall haue an ende, as ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> hath promiſed vs: for now you ſee what content one takes in recounting of aduerſities, that are gone and paſt, when ſhe is free from them; and contrarie what greefe, when we ſtill ſuffer them. Of purpoſe (ſaide <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) wee tooke fit time for our diſcourſes, bicauſe we might haue had opportunitie to know all. But bicauſe thy will is to the contrarie, wee will not gainſay it, to ſatisfie our owne. Whereupon with this that <hi>Stela</hi> told them, they knewe what great reaſon <hi>Delicius, Stela,</hi> and <hi>Crimine</hi> had to be ſorrowfull, who were partly no leſſe for pittie of theſe fower vnfortunate louers. The night being come, they went in, and after they had ſupped they went all to take their reſt, they at the leaſt that were capable of it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll that companie comming foorth, (except <hi>Felicta,</hi> and
<hi>Pariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> with ſome Nymphes that tarried ſtill praying in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) in a cleere morning, the day was but a little ſpent, when the aire changed on a ſudden with ſuch thunders and ſtormie tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtes, that what with feare of the lightning, and with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſeemed to threaten them, they were nowe going in againe, when they heard a Shepherd ſinging a farre off, and who (they thought) was comming towards them. And hearing him, they ſaide. It <pb n="302" facs="tcp:23115:154"/>ſeems he cares but litle for the iniury of the weather. They all agreed to ſtay for him: who not tarrying long from comming out of the wood, where his way lay, &amp; ſeeing ſo many togither, maruelled much, and left of his ſinging. But they woondred more when he came nigh them, to behold his ſtrange kind of habit. For he had on the skin of a beaſt called <hi>Hiena,</hi> tied about his middle with a great wreath of leaues like to Bryony, or the white vine, which runs winding about the bodies of trees like a ſnake. On his head he ware a Laurell crowne, &amp; in his hand, in ſteed of his ſheepehook, he caried a great bough of a figge tree. All which when they had well marked, they ſaid vnto him. Tell vs, iolly Shepherd, is this thy common wearing? No, ſaid he, but as I nowe vſe to weare this or ſome ſuch like, as the qualitie of the time ſhall counſell me, arming my ſelfe euer againſt the iniuries of it. And therefore I clad me thus, as at this preſent you ſee me, bicauſe I would not be ſmitten with the furious lightning, not thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derclap, which the vertue of any one of theſe doth maruellouſly reſiſt, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other things that came not ſo ſoone to my hands. We are glad to know it, ſaide they; but bicauſe the rigour of this day warnes vs to put our ſelues vnder couert, do vs this pleaſure (Shepherd) to come in with vs here to
<hi>Dianas</hi> temple. The good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port &amp; fame of this houſe, &amp; your noble company ſhal carie me in, although in ſuch a time as this, by the aduiſe of a cunning and expert Shepherd that dwels amongſt vs, it is not ſafe to be in ſtatelie and high buildings. Why ſo, ſaide Lord
<hi>Felix?</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaide (anſwered the Shepherd) that the thunderclap as it comes not right down but circularwiſe, encounters with that which is higheſt, &amp; therfore alights for the moſt part on high places, as vpon towers &amp; caſtles: Whereas on the contrarie, if there be any in the field, (vnleſſe it ſmite vpon his bodie) it can do no harme; but he, that in high and loftie houſes lodgeth (though the thunderclap ſmite him not) may be killed or wounded with the ſtones, timber, or ſome other thing that may fall from thence. And may alſo be burned or choaked with the ſmoke of the fire, that is kindled in the wood, all which by experience haue beene often ſeene. But bicauſe of good will you inuite me, to do that which you requeſt me, I will go in, although I was determined to lay me downe and ſleepe, if I had found out ſome fit place for the purpoſe, bicauſe the thunderclap ſpareth thoſe (they ſay) that are aſleepe. Thou wilt liue too long ſaid <hi>Seluagia,</hi> ſince with ſo many defences thou doſt arme thy ſelf. Heereof thou maieſt be aſcertained, ſaid the Shepherd, for there is not any, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his life and health more then I do. So me thinkes, ſaid <hi>Seluagia,</hi> and the cauſe of it muſt be, that thou art not in loue. Naie, rather the contrarie (ſaid the Shepherd) which my ſong did euen now ſpeake of. Doſt thou loue then ſaide
<hi>Seluagia?</hi> I loue ſaid he with the greateſt bliſſe and ioy as thou haſt euer heard of. Not onely heard, but ſeene ſaid
<hi>Seluegia.</hi> For they are before thee. And this do I ſay, ſaid he. And I that, ſaid ſhe. Leaue of theſe ſpeeches ſaid Lord
<hi>Felix,</hi> and let vs go in. And do vs ſo much pleaſure, good Shepherd, to tell vs by the way if thou beeſt in loue. I am (ſaid he). Are theſe loues thine own, ſaid Lord <hi>Felix?</hi> They are mine (ſaid he) &amp; none others. I ſay not ſo, ſaid Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> but if they be properly of thee thy ſelfe. I haue not ſo many good parts, ſaid the Shepherd, to be enamoured of my ſelfe: and yet there is not any (I thinke) that loues me, as much as I do my ſelfe. But leauing this aſide, I loue, as much as poſſiblie I may, a moſt faire yoong Shepherdeſſe. Thy loue is not perfect ſaid Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> bicauſe thou ſaieſt, there is none whom thou loueſt as much as thy ſelfe. Why doth this hinder it (ſaid the Shepherd,) that it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? Why not, ſaid Lord <hi>Felix?</hi> Then by this I vnderſtand (ſaid the Shepherd) that there is none that loues in this degree: But rather beleeue the contrarie, ſaide Lord
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:23115:154"/>
                  <hi>Felix,</hi> for heere thou ſeeſt ſome, who woulde gladly hazard their heades for them whom they loue. This is an eaſie thing, ſaide the Shepherd, to ſaie it. And eaſier ſaid Lord
<hi>Felix</hi> to do it. I promiſe you ſir, ſaide the Shepherd, if death knocked at your dore, and if it were in your election to go with it your ſelfe, or to ſende your loue, that it might be ſeene what I ſay. But rather that which I affirme, ſaide Lord <hi>Felix.</hi> I thinke it a hard matter, ſaide the Shepherd. With theſe demands and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers they came to the Temple, where they reſted themſelues, and feaſted that new gueſt, who was well entertained of the ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> bicauſe ſhe knew him woorthie of it. After they had made an end of their great dinner, all of them requeſted him to ſing the ſong, that he came ſinging when he left it off at their ſight. He ſaide, he was well content, and glad if they woulde lende an eare vnto it, not for his voice, which was not woorth it, but for the matter which deſerued any good whatſoeuer: But requeſting, that ſome inſtrument might play to him, bicauſe his ſong might be the better ſet foorth, <hi>Doria</hi> by <hi>Felicias</hi> command, tooke a Harpe, and tuning it to the higheſt note that he would ſing, the reſt being all attentiue to him, he began thus.</p>

               <p>They could not hold their laughter at the Shepherds admonition, to whom <hi>Syluanus</hi> ſaid. By my faith, friend Shepherd, thou commeſt too late with thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. For to leaue of that, which we haue already for this yoong Shepherdeſſe, I thinke there is no remedie: And if thou termeſt this time loſt, we are not ſorie for it a whit. I would you were better aduiſed, ſaid the Shepherd, but I doe but my dutie. It is well, ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> that you (my ſonnes) are content with your lots, and he with his good fortune: of one thing I aſſure you (leauing aſide your loue, bicauſe we will make no compariſons) that this Shepherd loueth (and with the greateſt reaſon in the world) a ſoueraigne yoong Shepherdeſſe, endowed with many gifts and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the leſt whereof in her (as he ſaid in his ſong) is peregrine beautie. And his loue to her is ſo infinite and pure, as he alſo ſaid, that though he be many times in her preſence, yet neuer any wanton thought turned his minde awrie. Which in truth proceedes from her excellent and ſingular vertue. And ſo no man (I thinke) hath gone beyonde him in purer loue then he, as by his ſong you might well perceiue. With what greater purity, ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> could any Shepherd loue his Shepherdeſſe, then I did <hi>Diana?</hi> Indeede it was very great, ſaid <hi>Felicia;</hi> but in the ende thou didſt preſume to tell her of thy loue. It is true, ſaid <hi>Syrenus:</hi> why then behold, ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> how far the loue of this yoong Shepherde extendes, that he durſt neuer manifeſt this ſound and perfect affection to his Shepherdeſſe, thinking by doing ſo, he ſhould greatly offend her honour. Then let him tell vs (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) if thou thinkeſt it good, reuerend Ladie, ſome part of his chaſte loues, which thou commendeſt ſo much, bicauſe we may paſſe away, with ſomething, this gloomie euening. To this the Shepherd anſwered. It would content me greatly to ſpend this cloudie euening in ſo ioyfull a diſcourſe, if I were able to end it. But now in my ſong if you be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, I told you that I had another time ſung of her, and that for her great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſertes, I came very ſhort of her due praiſe. Being therefore ſomwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, I am determined to hold my peace, &amp; the rather bicauſe I haue no longer time <pb n="308" facs="tcp:23115:157"/>to ſtay, for I am going to ſeeke out a pretie fawne, which my Shepherdeſſe makes no ſmall account of: So that I muſt be forced to depart, ſooner then I would, from ſuch an honorable companie. Take no care for that, ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> for I haue taken order for it. But <hi>Delicius</hi> mooued with a certaine deſire to know, or rather with a ſecret inſtinct and motion from aboue, ſaid. If by entreatie I might obtaine at thy hands (fortunate Shepherd) to tell vs ſome curious things, ſuch as thou didſt tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thy habit, and who did firſt ſhew them thee, I ſhould thinke my ſelfe much bound to thee. More queſtions yet, ſaid <hi>Felicia:</hi> What doſt thou meane? Gracious yoong Shepherd, anſwered the Shepherd, thoſe, and many more I learned in the fertill fields, which the great riuer <hi>Duerus</hi> with his criſtalline fluents doth water in the Countie of <hi>Saint Stephen,</hi> of a famous Shepherd that came thither from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine parts, to whoſe skill and knowledge, it ſeemed, nature it ſelfe with all her ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was ſubiect. If I ſhould tell you of his graces, his vertues, and courteous beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, as to me it would be impoſſible, ſo to you it would be tedious, not being able to make an end. We all know (for it cannot otherwiſe be) that he is no Shepherd, although he faines it by his habit. Of one thing I can aſſure you, that with whom ſoeuer he conuerſeth, with great affection he winnes the ſame vnto him. O what great profit do we and our flockes receiue by his companie with vs? We, by eaſing vs of our continuall labours by his induſtrie; our flockes, by healing their common diſeaſes. If there were any gadding goat that eſtraying from his company, did put vs to trouble in ſeeking him, by cutting his beard, he made him keep ſtill with the flock. If the Ram, which for guide of the reſt we choſe out for the ſtouteſt, we could not make gentle, he made more milde then a lambe, by making holes thorow his hornes hard by his eares. If at any time we wanted tinder, lint, or a ſteele to ſmite fire with at our neede, he procured vs light, with rubbing two drie Laurell ſtickes the one againſt the other, or with the Mulberie ſticke againſt the Iuie, and a great deale bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Laurell ſticke againſt the Iuie, which being rubbed verie well, with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the duſt of brimeſtone vpon them, with great facilitie he got out fire. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct vs, and ſometimes to be merrie with vs, he vſed many pretie ieſtes amongſt vs: for he would ſecretly hang vpon the rackes in our ſheepe-folds, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the head or taile of a woolfe, by meanes whereof, not onely the leſſer flockes, as our lambes, ſheep, durſt not once take a mouthfull of fodder laid there before them, but alſo the greater, as Oxen, Horſes, and the reſt would ſtand and eat nothing. We being ignorant of the cauſe thereof, thought the cattell had ſome diſeaſe, and he perceiuing vs to be greeued for it, tooke them away againe, but ſo priuily that we might not ſee him. Whereupon the cattell falling to their woonted feeding, we helde it for a woonder, ſeeing them on the ſudden ſo whole againe. When we were in the fields, miſdoubting nothing, and our goats feeding apace, he would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly put an herbe into one of their mouths called <hi>Eringius,</hi> wherewith he made not that Goat alone ſtiffe and num, and not to feed; but all the reſt in company of that, to leaue of feeding. We maruelling thereat, and not able to make them feed, asked ſome remedie of him for it. Who faining then to make ſome characters vpon the Goat, into whoſe mouth he had put the herbe (bicauſe we might thinke it proceeded of his owne vertue) tooke it out of her mouth, and then did ſhe, and all the reſt feed apace. Theſe prettie deceits he vſed in all things to make vs woonder at him the more, and bicauſe we might not vnderſtand that it was not the naturall virtue of thoſe things. The maſter Goat, whom we call the leader of the reſt, he tooke out of the flocke by the beard, and in an inſtant, the whole flocke, ſtanding like ſenceleſſe <pb n="309" facs="tcp:23115:157"/>things forget their foode, vntill he let him goe againe. I omit other infinite deceits, which we thought impoſſible to be done by naturall meanes, bicauſe he made no mention of them (though he ſhewed me their ſecrets) for that they were not things belonging to Shepherdes. And many of theſe I haue forgotten. He made mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruoſities in the trees, &amp; corne, preſeruing them from that which might hurt them, and haſtening their fruite, yea, and chaunging their nature. Hee deliuered the trees from any kinde of canker, and worme, and the corne from tempeſtes, and the birdes that came to deuoure it, with a certaine thing that he put in ſeede, he tooke them with his handes. He euer prouided vs with good ſtore of fiſh out of that famous riuer, wherein, with caſting the roule of Hartwoort, beaten and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with lyme or chalke, to the which paſte the fiſh comming with all their force, and by taſting of the baite, did ſwim a pretie while as if they had beene dead, with their bellies aboue the water. And it was a ſtrange thing to ſee, howe ſoone they came to the nets that he had laid for them; for I thinke hee did caſt in the ſeedes of roſes, muſtard-ſeede, and weſell foote. I remember not what herbe he tooke in his hand, but putting it into the water, the fiſh did ſwim aboue. It were an endles peece of worke to tell you of the inſtructions, which hee gaue vs to take heede from what paſtures wee ſhoulde keepe our flockes, and what we ſhould ſeeke out. But to ſee with what ſecuritie he ſlept in places where were great ſtore of ſnakes, adders, and vipers, and other venemous and ſtinging ſerpents, it was a maruellous and ſtrange thing, enuironing onely himſelfe with Oken boughes, from the ſhadowes of which trees, we ſee by experience theſe vermine euer to flie. And other things he did in our preſence, bicauſe we ſhould ſee the hatred they had with this tree, for he made halfe a circle of fire, and another halfe circle of theſe boughes, and in the middes of it did caſt a viper, the which not able to come out, but by the fire or the boughes, to auoide theſe, came to the fire. Hee did eate the deade fleſh of a woolfe, for he ſaide, and ſo we found it indeed, that it was more ſauorie then any other fleſh: but he did not cloth himſelfe with their skins, nor haire, bicauſe he ſaid, they bred lice. He told vs of certaine howers, &amp; times, and taught vs the nature of diuers things. By the moone he prognoſticated the ſcarcitie or plentie of all that moneth. By the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tree, white Poplar, Oliue tree, and others the Solſticies ſhewing to our eies, how they turned their leaues vp and downe in euery one of them, whether it were winter or ſommer. The howers of the day, with the beames that he marked in the ground. Them of the night with certaine little tables that he made. The highth of the ſun, by an herbe of a blue colour. The fuls and wanes of the Moone, by the Antes and dores. For the Antes betweene the Moones take their reſt, and in the full, labour night and day. And that which made mee to maruell moſt about this matter (bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being ſo common a thing, I neuer marked it ſo much, thinking there was not any thing in them worthy the noting) was that the dore, a little creature, ſo vile, and common, had ſuch an inſtinct, that if we looke into it well, it ſhewes vs cleerely the coniunction of the Moone and Sunne. For rolling vp and downe a little ball which ſhe makes of oxe dung, ſhe faſhions it in a round figure, and buries it in a ditch, or little pit that ſhe makes, where eight and twentie daies ſhe keepes it ſecret, while the Moone is paſſing towards the Sunne; and then opening it, (by that teaching vs the coniunction of the Sunne and the Moone,) ſhe takes foorth her yoong ones, and knowes no other waies of generation. And with this pardon me, if I haue wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried you. If you deſire to know any more, another day, if we be al togither, I wil tell you the little, that I haue noted and gathered of that great ſtore, which that learned
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:23115:158"/>Shepherd beſtowed among vs. They all ſaid, they were glad to heare, and deſired greatly that he woulde paſſe on farther. By that which I haue nowe heard of thee, (ſaid <hi>Syrenus</hi>) and by that which not many daies ſince I heard of a Shpeherd called <hi>Firmius,</hi> if thou knoweſt him, who now keeps our ſheep, this wiſe Shepherd is called
<hi>Coryneus.</hi> By that which now I heare of thee, and not long ſince haue heard, ſaide the Shepherd, thou ſhouldſt be either forgotten
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> or deſpiſed <hi>Syluanus. Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> I know very well: for he is one of my greateſt friends I euer had or ſhall haue, and it is true, that this is the learned Shepherds name, of whom I ſpake. I confeſſe, ſaide <hi>Syrenus,</hi> that I am the man forgotten, and nowe it greeues me not much, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it made me once ſorrowfull, But bicauſe
<hi>Firmius</hi> tolde mee manie things woorthy to be remembred, and by that which thou haſt nowe tolde vs of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and acquaintance, I geſſe thy name is <hi>Partheus.</hi> It is ſo, ſaide he. I knowe not, ſaide <hi>Seluagia,</hi> how thou haſt made ſo large an account of
<hi>Coryneus,</hi> leauing his yoong Shepherdeſſe called <hi>Dinia,</hi> bicauſe <hi>Firmius</hi> tolde vs ſhe was paſſing faire, wiſe, and vertuous. Ah Shepherdeſſe, I dare not name her with my vnwoorthie mouth, for if I would go about to ſet foorth her praiſes, I thinke I ſhould but dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, ſince there is no iudgement, nor conceite able to vnfolde the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in her: Let it ſuffice you to know, that ſhe is a yoong Shepherdeſſe, whom I reuerence for her ſingular vertues. And if I ſhould ſpeake of euery thing, I would not omit a daughter to them both, but yet twelue yeeres of age, that in beautie, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and diſcretion is the right type and figure of her parents; to whom the fawne, that is loſt, belongs, and whom I loue ſo much, that I dare not come before her ſight, vnles I bring it with me, or know at the leaſt where it is. And ſo, bicauſe I know what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent I ſhal giue my Shepherdeſſe, for that which the yong Shepherdeſſe ſhal haue, I know not what I were beſt to do to finde it out, to preſent it to her with mine owne hands. And it is not without good cauſe indeede that ſhe loues it ſo much, bicauſe you would ſay the Gods had endowed it with vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to ſerue <hi>Luztea,</hi> (for ſo is this moſt faire yoong Shepherdeſſe called.) Tell me
<hi>Partheus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> how long is it ſince thou didſt ſee thy friend <hi>Firmius?</hi> For if thou deſireſt to ſee him, I can ſoone leade thee to him, where he is. I thanke thee (ſaid
<hi>Partheus</hi>) for thy good will. It is not yet a moneth ſince I laſt ſawe him, the thing that I deſire moſt in the world, and truely it greeued me to ſee him in ſuch a caſe as he was in, bicauſe I thinke the loue of the ingratefull Shepherdeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> will make an ende of his life: for his owne greefe, thinking it not ſufficient to make him leade ſuch a ſorrowfull life, hath conſpired with a forrain greefe to raiſe vp a great corriual againſt him, a iolly yoong Shepherd, wiſe, and rich, called <hi>Faustus.</hi> What is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Syluanus,</hi> that <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> loues <hi>Diana?</hi> It is ſo, anſwered
<hi>Partheus,</hi> and that not a little. Indeed he tolde vs, ſaid
<hi>Seluagia,</hi> when we were comming hither, that he deſired to ſee
<hi>Diana</hi> for the great report of her beautie: And nowe hee hath ſeene it, ſaide <hi>Partheus,</hi> and I thinke, will not praiſe the good market he made. I warned him well before, ſaid <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus.</hi> But theſe Shepherds mooue me to pitie them, for I know by experience in what troubles
<hi>Diana</hi> will put them, and how ill they will deliuer themſelues againe. <hi>Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Syluanus</hi> would haue asked him, how
<hi>Firmius</hi> did, when two Nymphes came in bringing with them the little faune. Which when <hi>Partheus</hi> ſaw, he roſe vp ioyfully to go to it, which fauned on him with skipping and leaping vpon his breaſt and licked his face. <hi>Partheus</hi> began to ſpeake verie louingly to it, as if it vnderſtood him. All of them reioyced to ſee it; for beſides, that it was a moſt faire one, it was ſo finely ſet out, that it inuited all eies to behold it. And bicauſe it would be too long <pb n="311" facs="tcp:23115:158"/>to recount the fables and hiſtories, that were wrote in a little ſaddle cloth, and collar it had on, I will not ſpeake of it; but onely that in the collar which was the fineſt of all the reſt, there was a poſie that ſaid thus:
<q>
                     <l>To <hi>Luztea</hi> faire I do belong, this collar can auouch it,</l>
                     <l>Let no man therefore be ſo bold, without her leaue to touch it.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Pariſiles</hi> hauing read it, ſaid. The Miſtreſſe of it hath a great opinion (it ſeemes) and confidence of her ſelfe, thinking it is enough for her to ſay (bicauſe it is hers) that no bodie ſhould touch it. Say not ſo (ſaid <hi>Partheus</hi>) for there is nothing in <hi>Luztea</hi> woorthie of reprehenſion: whereas it is well knowen, that ſhe may ſay ſo, and the rather that ſhe did not put it on her ſelfe: for I would willingly tell you, why ſhe ſuffered it to weare this collar, but that it is not now time to know it. And none againe ſhould be blamed in abſence; and ſince you are alſo ignorant of the cauſe, it were better (me thinkes) by your fauour, that you held your peace. This is no place ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> ſtepping in betweene them, for ſuch words as theſe are. If I haue (Ladie <hi>Felicia</hi>) in any thing offended, ſaid
<hi>Partheus,</hi> I craue pardon of thee, and of this reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend old man, deſiring you to hold me excuſed for anſwering in her behalfe, to whom I am ſo much bound, not induring that any thing ſhould be ſpoken in her diſgrace any waies. I promiſe thee Shepherd, ſaide <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> I neuer ment any ſuch matter, but to approoue the vertues and deſerts, that thou haſt reported of her; for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which I ſpake of is, that ſince ſhe woulde do no hurt to any, ſhe alſo thought that none ſhould offer any to her, &amp; for this cauſe ſhe would ſhew by the poſie, that it was her own. It is wel, ſaid <hi>Felicia,</hi> but leauing this aſide, giue attentiue eare to that, which for the profit and pleaſure of you all, I will haue you do to morrow morning. I know well <hi>Partheus,</hi> it will be no pleaſure for thee to ſtaie heere vntill the next daies light, bicauſe thou wouldeſt gladly ſee thy Shepherdeſſe, for the good newes thou carrieſt with thee. But bicauſe thy ſtaying heere ſhall be for her profit, and her husbands, I hope thou wilt not thinke it greeuous, nor too long: And bicauſe thou maiſt vnderſtand it ſo, know, that by my means this faune was loſt, by ſtraying ſo far beyond his woonted faſhion, and let this ſuffice thee. It is expedient therefore (for let not any gainſay what I ſhall ordaine or thinke conuenient) that thou <hi>Partheus</hi> carrie with thee to <hi>Coryneus</hi> and to his Shepherdeſſe, this yoong Shepherd (pointing to <hi>Delicius</hi>) and ſhalt deliuer him a letter from me, which I will write this night, and he ſhall take order for that, which I purpoſe to do. It is needfull for thee <hi>Syrenus,</hi> to accompanie them to thy fieldes, for that way doth his lie, bicauſe there are newe matters in hand. When ſhe had ſaid thus after ſupper, &amp; paſſed a little of the night in their woonted paſtimes, they went to bed, though <hi>Crimine</hi> and <hi>Stela</hi> coulde not ſleepe all that night for greefe of
<hi>Delicius</hi> departure. And it was to be thought, that he ſlept as little as they, for it greeued him to depart and leaue ſo good companie, wherein he tooke the greateſt ioy in the worlde, but he coulde not chuſe, but obey <hi>Felicias</hi> pleaſure, for the great hope and truſt he had in her. The morning therefore being come, before the three Shepherds tooke their leaue, <hi>Felicia</hi> gaue <hi>Syrenus</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine potion to make him by litle &amp; litle leeſe the contempt forgetfulnes that he had of
<hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Delicius</hi> a letter to carrie to <hi>Coryneus,</hi> admoniſhing him to call himſelfe by the name of <hi>Caulius,</hi> and to tell him nothing of his owne matters, nor aske him any queſtions concerning the ſame, bicauſe it was not good for him, vntill he came thither againe. The contents of the letter were theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:23115:159"/>TO thee (noble <hi>Diſteus</hi>)
<hi>Felicia,</hi> ſeruant and miniſter in the Temple of chaſte
<hi>Diana,</hi> ſends all the health I may. The Gods haue determined to make a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of thy infinite troubles, and to augment thine honor and eſtate, and haue dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to humble themſelues without any merit of mine, to make a mediatrix for thee. It is therefore requiſite, that with as much expedition as thou canſt, thou be heere with thy deere ſpouſe <hi>Dardauea,</hi> accompanied with thy louing nurſe <hi>Palua,</hi> and thy faire daughter
<hi>Luztea.</hi> This yoong Shepherd the bearer hereof ſhall beare thee companie, and is one, who ſhall beſt pleaſe thee. Be not deſirous to enquire more of him, then he will tel thee of his own accord. I wil be no longer, bicauſe I hope very ſhortly to ſee thee: And as for theſe wordes, I doubt not, but thou wilt credit, and alſo her, that could write vnto thee, and the reſt, ſo right by their owne names. This being done, the three Shepherds went their waies, hauing taken their leaue of all the reſt. Then that very night <hi>Felicia</hi> in preſence of them all began to ſpeake in this ſort to Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> and his wife,
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> and his Shepherdeſſe. I know well Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and my ſonnes, that I withhold you more then is conuenient from going to your owne houſes: but bicauſe it hath fallen out ſo to all the reſt, as afterwards you ſhall ſee, and bicauſe you may know the Shepherd that I haue ſent for, and ſee the ſucceſſe of his comming hither, and of
<hi>Pariſiles, Stela, Crimine,</hi> and their Shepherds, I haue deferred it, ſince it ſhall not be any long time with the ſoueraigne wils aboue. All fower anſwered, that what, or howſoeuer ſhe diſpoſed of them, they tooke it for no ſmall fauour. A little after that, Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> and
<hi>Feliſmena,</hi> came to <hi>Felicia,</hi> ſaying. Bicauſe it is alreadie manifeſt vnto vs (moſt ſage Ladie) that nothing is hid from thy wiſedome and knowledge, we pray thee to reſolue vs in this (which troubles vs not a little) bicauſe we do not know it. <hi>Delicius,</hi> and his companie theſe few daies paſt told vs as it were by peecemeale parts, the abrupt proceſſe of their liues and loues from their infancie vnto the preſent eſtate they are now in; and though we know not who they are, it skils not much, and we care not greatly for it in reſpect of the earneſt deſire we haue to know the cauſe why <hi>Delicius</hi> did forſake (if it be ſo) faire <hi>Stelas</hi> loue, who loued her ſo much as he did, and at that time when he had receiued moſt fauour of her. Whereof (as it ſeemed)
<hi>Stela</hi> was either ignorant, or elſe would not tell it. Bicauſe I know you will keepe the cauſe ſecret (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) that mooued
<hi>Delicius</hi> to do it, I will tell it you. You muſt therefore know, that he left not of to loue her, but fained to do it (as he yet verie finely diſſembles the ſame) vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding how his deere friend
<hi>Parthenius</hi> loued her (by ſhewing thereby the greateſt part of friendſhip) he gaue place to his friends affection, and reſolued to go without her himſelfe. A ſtrange example of friendſhip ſaid they all, although, it ſeemes, it was no leſſe due to <hi>Parthenius.</hi> But Ladie, we alſo ſuſpecting this, as <hi>Stela</hi> doth no leſſe, are deſious to know, how he knew it, for by her diſcourſe we could not gather it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how he did ſo well diſſemble it. I will tell you ſaid <hi>Felicia.</hi> You muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber well (as <hi>Stela</hi> told you) that for the rigorous anſwer that <hi>Parthenius</hi> gaue to
<hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> when ſhe manifeſted her loue vnto him, ſhe determined not to goe where the Shepherds were, to prooue if abſence could worke that in her, which it did in many: by reaſon whereof ſome daies paſſed on, in which they were not viſited of them, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (without <hi>Crimine</hi>)
<hi>Stela</hi> durſt not aduenture, but for ſhamefaſtnes left of to goe to their woonted ſports. In theſe ſo ſorrowfull daies for <hi>Delicius, Parthenius,</hi> and <hi>Stela,</hi> and <hi>Crimine,</hi> in the which theſe fower did not ſee one another, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times they were wont to do, there came ſome Nymphes to keepe the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds <pb n="313" facs="tcp:23115:159"/>companie, and to paſſe away the time with them, but they took no pleaſure in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, although outwardly they diſſembled it, as by ſinging, playing on their inſtruments, &amp; other paſtimes. From the which ſports
<hi>Parthenius</hi> on a time faining a little buſines, that he had to go into the wood, went from that company, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the thickeſt of it, in a ſecret place a good way off ſat him downe, where muſing vpon many matters, and ſeeing how needfull it was for him to depart from his Miſtreſſe, by reaſon of the menaces of cruell <hi>Gorphorost</hi> againſt <hi>Delicius,</hi> as it was told you, he was many times about to kill himſelfe, but would not put it in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, onely bicauſe he knew
<hi>Delicius</hi> would follow him therein; as alſo for that, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bliſſe and hope of ſeeing his Miſtres any more would haue ended. Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a greater while there, then was needfull for the cauſe of his abſence, from his friend, <hi>Delicius</hi> asked leaue of the Nymphes to go ſee why <hi>Parthenius</hi> ſtaied ſo long. And ſo ſeeking and finding him, he came to him, where he lay flat vpon his bellie with his mouth to the grounde, who ſeeing him in this ſort, and thinking hee was aſleepe, came ſo ſoftly to him, that <hi>Parthenius</hi> could not perceiue him; and in verie truth, being in ſuch extreme greefe of minde and deepe imaginations as hee was, though he had come as faſt, and as loud as he could, I thinke, he had not heard him. As theſe two were therefore thus togither, and <hi>Parthenius</hi> now &amp; then ſpeaking to himſelfe, thinking that no body heard him, he vttered ſuch lamentable wordes and complaints of himſelfe and of his hard fortune, that <hi>Delicius</hi> knew by and by he was a true-louer of <hi>Stela,</hi> and that for his ſake hee diſſembled the ſame ſo much: when <hi>Delicius,</hi> perceiued this, he went ſoftly from thence againe, bicauſe he would not be ſeene of
<hi>Parthenius,</hi> the better to do that which he had now determined. Whereby he might ſhew that in his loue and friendſhip to <hi>Parthenius,</hi> he had no leſſe integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and degree then <hi>Parthenius</hi> in his, or to endeuour (at the leaſt) to be euen with it. And ſo without ſpeaking or doing any thing, he went backe to the Nymphes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he coulde not finde him, but hoped he woulde not be long away. After a good while
<hi>Parthenius</hi> came (to all their thinkings) very ioyfull, which made
<hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> not a little to maruell, knowing in what a miſerable plight he had leſt him; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he gathered, it was but a ſayned gladnes, bicauſe hee might not ſuſpect his greefe. From this point therefore,
<hi>Delicius</hi> by little and little (bicauſe he would not be ſuſpected doing it on the ſudden) began to ſhew himſelf very cold in
<hi>Stelas</hi> loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merrier then he was wont to be, &amp; ſaying it was needleſſe to paſſe ſorrowes and greefes for one, that made no account of them, nor cared a whit for him: which (he ſaid) he cleerely perceiued, ſince ſo many daies ſhe ſtaied without comming to ſee him; and that he had done a great deale better, if hee had employed his loue on
<hi>Crimine,</hi> then on her, of whom (perhaps) hee might haue beene rewarded: ſo that with this he ſhewed, that he made no great account of
<hi>Stela,</hi> and to beare no ſmall affection to <hi>Crimine.</hi> But for all this <hi>Parthenius</hi> would neuer declare his loue, for he rather ſuſpected that this was but a deuiſe to trie if hee loued <hi>Stela,</hi> then once thought that <hi>Delicius</hi> knewe it, the which hee imagined not at all. But as <hi>Delicius</hi> coulde not by theſe meanes bring the truth out of <hi>Parthenius</hi> to light, by forcing himſelfe as much as he coulde, he ſung and plaied many merrie things, like a man free from loue, and without ſpeaking any thing of <hi>Stela,</hi> which was different from his wonted cuſtome, which he did not onely put in practiſe, but determined to doe more if they met togither, as he did indeed, when face to face he told
<hi>Stela</hi> that hee loued her not. And behold heere, what you deſired to know. We are ſatisfied, ſaid Lord <hi>Felix,</hi> and truely it was a great part of friendſhip betweene them both. But <pb n="312" facs="tcp:23115:160"/>

               <p>But it ſhall not be amiſſe, that, leauing theſe Gentlemen heere, we go on with the three Shepherds, which went where
<hi>Diana</hi> was, if you will, that we beginne to helpe <hi>Syrenus,</hi> who now with his potion that <hi>Felicia</hi> had giuen him, began to feele a tendernes of loue, entring in by the paſſage of the late paſſed obliuion, and a certain diſcontentment of <hi>Firmius</hi> and
<hi>Faustus</hi> loues, that followed the ſame.

<hi>Faustus</hi> going vp and downe to ſeeke <hi>Diana</hi> (for now he knew ſhe was gone to the field) by chance he light vpon the place, where they were; who with the greefe he had to ſee her ſo fortunate in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as vnfortunate by marriage, came ſinging this old dittie. <pb n="315" facs="tcp:23115:161"/>

               <p>The which he had ſcarce begun, when hee eſpied
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Firmius</hi> togither. Which ſight (if it greeued him not) I leaue to your iudgements. But as the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are hurtfull to a louer to amend them, by diſſembling notwithſtanding his greefe, he came and ſaluted them. <hi>Diana</hi> by and by cauſed him to ſit downe by her on the other ſide. But before I paſſe any farther, you muſt knowe that
<hi>Diana,</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge herſelfe a little of the great paſſion that made her complaine of her diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, of purpoſe beſtowed fauours on both, though ſmall ones; which maner of hers did ariſe of a deſire ſhe had in this ſort to paſſe away, and forget her aſſlicted life.
<hi>Faustus</hi> (as I told you but now) with the deſire onely to ſee that beautie ſo much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by fame, going from his owne fieldes came to thoſe where <hi>Diana</hi> kept. With whom he ſpent ſome daies in good companie very freely (eſpecially for her part) for as it ſeemed, he was in loue with another yoong Shepherdeſſe in his owne countrie. <hi>Diana</hi> liked well of his diſcretion and wiſedome, and therefore loued him a little, as
<hi>Firmius</hi> no leſſe for the like good parts in him. So that to ſee which of them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led each other, ſhe ſet them many times togither in contention, to trie them both in diſcourſe and ſong. Wherein each of them to pleaſe her, as of their owne ſelues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo willing to the ſame, ſtudied for nothing elſe. Whereupon aroſe a certaine kinde of emulation betweene them, not bicauſe they hated one another, but bicauſe one endeuoured to excell the other before the faire Shepherdeſſe. Whereupon it came into their heads, that there paſſed not one day, nor yet I thinke there is anie, wherein they ſtriue not either in wreſtling, pitching of the barre, ſinging, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and in other things, which we Shepherds make account of, appointing euer iudges to crowne the Conquerour; but the one neuer went ſo ſmoothly away with the victory, that the other went cleerly without it: for <hi>Firmius</hi> was neuer conqueror, nor <hi>Fauſtus</hi> conquered; nor <hi>Fauſtus</hi> conqueror, nor <hi>Firmius</hi> conquered. Of this emulation and corriualitie, there were none, but tooke great delight to ſee it, and eſpecially <hi>Diana</hi> aboue the reſt; who to make them contend the more, on a day, after certaine talke that had paſſed betweene
<hi>Fauſtus</hi> and her, ſmiling alone to her ſelfe, ſhe ſaid vnto him. As thou ſpeakeſt (me thinkes Shepherd) with great libertie and boldnes; ſo are thy words full of ſuttletie and diſſimulation. O that I might ſee thee one day ſo far in loue with me, that thou mighteſt once pay me this ouermuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. From this hower therefore <hi>Fauſtus</hi> began to loue <hi>Diana,</hi> and leeſe his libertie: whereof he had now verie little or none at all, when he came to the place where <hi>Diana</hi> and
<hi>Firmius</hi> were. But returning to this point (bicauſe as I was not preſent at the other, I cannot tell it you) as he was ſet downe,
<hi>Diana</hi> ſaid vnto him. Do vs this pleaſure Shepherd, to ſing that againe which thou cameſt ſinging. Who without more adoe tooke out his Rebecke, and began thus.</p>

They endeuouring to comfort her, gaue her ſome hope, ſaying, that in the end ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and griefes are not perpetuall, and that ſhe ſhould remember that common ſong that ſaith.

                     <l>Continuall griefe and ſorrow neuer wanteth, &amp;c.</l>

               <p>Bicauſe therefore you may ſee (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) how ill this ſaying is vnderſtoode, tune your Bagpipe with your Rebecke, and walking towards our flockes, bicauſe it is now time to gather them vp, although I thought not to doe it, yet will I ſing as well as I can vpon this theame, and you ſhall take the tune of the ſong, as of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſo much tuned in miſeries and miſhappes as nothing more. <hi>Firmius</hi> and

<hi>Faustus;</hi> and truely if that which he now ſings, be no leſſe commendable and delightfull, then that, which he then ſung, it would not
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:23115:165"/>greeue vs to ſtay heere a little, and lend him a gentle eare. But approching neere, bicauſe the ſong went verie low, for that it was mournfull, and full of lamentation, they ſaw it was a Shepherdeſſe, who eſpying them againe, held her peace. They came to her, and ſaluting each other, prayed her courteouſly, not to leaue of her ſinging. You may better ſay ſorrowing, ſaid <hi>Cardenia,</hi> for this was her name. Be it as thou wilt, ſaid <hi>Delicius,</hi> and ouercome vs by entitling it as pleaſeth thee, and let vs ouercome thee in doing that which we requeſt thee.

Whereupon doſt thou repoſe ſuch aſſurance, ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> laughing, that we would fauour thee, and not take this faire Shepherdeſſe her part?

Theſe words greeued <hi>Syrenus</hi> to the hart, who now by little and little began to renew his old decayed loue. And this is my griefe, ſaid <hi>Cardenia,</hi> that the more I procure to lay his ingratitude before mine eies, the more doth his loue penetrate my ſoule. Wherefore hearken to that which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of me, and which I came ſinging all alone complaining of my iniurious <hi>Faustus.</hi>

               <p>To any of theſe I neuer had an anſwer, wherupon I think he neuer made account of them, and of the laſt eſpecially, bicauſe he had now quite forgotten me when that came. Of one thing I will aduiſe thee, ſaide <hi>Syrenus,</hi> if thou wilt take it at my handes. This thou maieſt be ſure of, ſaid <hi>Cardenia,</hi> for I thinke there is none, that would not wiſh to haue ſom remedy of her ils, if there were any meanes for them. The meanes ſaid <hi>Syrenus,</hi> are eaſie enough for thee, that haſte ſuch libertie, as I vnderſtoode by <hi>Fauſtus.</hi> And it is to accompanie vs to the place where he is, bicauſe our waies lie thereby. For I cannot beleeue, but thy preſence wil make him, with crauing pardon, acknowledge his fault. This counſell <hi>Syrenus</hi> gaue her, to remooue ſuch a block out of his way, as <hi>Faustus</hi> was. All of them liked his aduiſe well, but <hi>Cardenia</hi> beſt of all, and therefore anſwered thus. It is therefore needfull for you (my friendes) if you will ſhew me ſo much friendſhip, and vſe this pitie towards me to tarry for me, if it pleaſe you, while I take ſome order for certaine kine, which I keepe harde by heere, and commit them to the keeping of a Shepherd, that (certes) loues me more then <hi>Faustus,</hi> who, I hope, will take the charge vpon him with a good will. But I muſt in no hand tell him whither I go, bicauſe with patience he cannot endure it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will faine that I go to ſome other place. In the meane time I will giue you ſuch entertainment as my poore abilitie can affoord, though not good enough for your deſerts. Vpon this requeſt they determined to ſtaie, and ſhe went to ſeeke out the Shepherd, whom ſhe found out by and by, for ſhe knewe where he was commonly woont to feed. <hi>Cariſus,</hi> for this was the Shepherds name, ſeeing
<hi>Cardenia</hi> comming to him contrarie to her wonted cuſtome, went with no little ioy to meete her, and ſaluting her, ſaide thus vnto her. What noueltie is this, my deereſt Shepherdeſſe, from whence comes ſo much good, that this happie ſoule of mine deigneth to come to viſite this miſerable bodie of hers? <hi>Cardenia,</hi> who would rather haue heard thoſe words in <hi>Faustus</hi> mouth, then of <hi>Cariſus,</hi> interrupted him, ſaying. Neceſſitie, which, to leaue my kine in thy keeping, while I goe hard by to ſee a kinſwoman of mine, bringes me to ſeeke out ſuch a Shepherd, that they may not feele my abſence, and as I put no greater truſt in any for this matter then in thee, I come to knowe if thou wilt take this charge vpon thee. <hi>Cariſus</hi> putting ſome ſtrings on his Rebecke, that he had in his hand, and tuning voice to this that followes, anſwered <hi>Cardemas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt thus, taking for his ground (bicauſe it made ſo fit for his purpoſe) that common

But what ſaieſt thou, ſaid <hi>Cariſus,</hi> to that which I craue of thee? What craueſt thou ſaid <hi>Cardenia,</hi> for truely I gaue no attentiue eare vnto thee, I was thinking ſo much of my departure. Is this the reward anſwered <hi>Cariſus,</hi> that I looked for at thy hands, for keeping thy kine? Yet do what thou wilt, and go whither thou wilt, for in the end I cannot chuſe (as euer more I do) but obey thy command, and thinke my ſelfe ſufficiently appaide (if thou wilt not condeſcend to any other thing) that with thine owne mouth thou haſt made me the herdeſman of thy kine: for ſince I haue paſſed ſo many troubles for thy ſake without any guerdon, I will alſo paſſe away this greefe without any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, ſo that thou receiueſt contentment hereby; and this ſhal be enough for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which I expect, wherein I finde no ſmall ioy and contentment.

And with this, bicauſe I go to ſet other things in order, I take my leaue of thee: thou ſhalt finde my kine to morrow in the place where thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt they are commonly wont to be. When ſhe had diſpatched this buſines, ſhe went to the Shepherds, that were neerer to her, then ſhe was aware of; for when ſhe went from them, they followed her to ſee what paſſed betweene them, whereat they tooke no ſmall delight, and laughed not a little when
<hi>Cariſus</hi> ſaid in his ſong, that if ſhe was aſhamed to giue him a kiſſe, he would with her leaue take it himſelfe. Hauing therefore prepared all things neceſſarie for her iourney, ſhee went her waies next day in the morning in the companie of thoſe three yoong Shepherds, whom we will now leaue, ſince they knowe (without vs) howe to finde out this

<hi>Pariſiles</hi> therefore, <hi>Stela</hi> and <hi>Crimine,</hi> remayning there all alone (you may now imagine, if deſirous to ſee him, that ſhould tell that, which ſo faine they would haue knowen eſpecially <hi>Stela,</hi> and <hi>Crimine,</hi> that without compariſon cared not to know any other matter then this) <hi>Felicia</hi> ſent a Nymph to call <hi>Placindus</hi> to her, who was now gone to view the ſumptuous Palace, who being come before her, ſhe ſaide thus vnto him. O worthie example of a loyall ſeruant, doubt not but that thy good <pb n="330" facs="tcp:23115:169"/>deeds (though lately) ſhall be rewarded by the higheſt, aſſuring thy ſelfe that the deferring thereof ſhall more augment the requitall: For otherwiſe if good deeds were not requited by ſome waies, we might haue iuſt occaſion to complaine of his diuine power: I ſay by ſome meanes, as touching that he hath promiſed vs, bicauſe otherwiſe he oweth vs nothing, but we are rather perpetually obliged to his diuine eſſence, not onely that he hath made vs rationall creatures (the higheſt eſtate in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) when it lies in his celeſtiall power to faſhion vs to that, which is accounted the loweſt &amp; moſt ſeruile in the world: vnto the likenes whereof though he might haue made vs, who was beſides no leſſe able to leaue vs without being, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt infelicitie, next after eternall damnation. But leauing this aſide, as well bicauſe larger time then that we haue, were neceſſarie for it; as alſo bicauſe the place doth not require it, I will (according to this) tell thee in briefe, that heere in this houſe thou haſt made an end of thy great iourney, finding in the ſame that which thou couldſt not find in ſo manie countries. Here ſhall thy trauels end, and all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of theſe Gentlemen, and with greater proſperitie you ſhall returne to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired heauen. Here you ſhall ſhortly ſee how many of you wander vp and downe like baniſhed men, and more then you thinke of. In concluſion, in a few daies thou ſhalt ſee in this Temple of chaſte <hi>Diana</hi> thy louing Lord and Ladie, and thy deer Aunt. <hi>Placindus,</hi> at ſo ioyfull newes, breaking off ſo ſweete a ſpeech, and not knowing how to requte her, proſtrate vpon the ground, kiſſed her hands. <hi>Felicia</hi> tooke him vp againe, ſaying. It is therefore needfull for thee (as a thing that concernes thy Lord and Ladie) to tell the beginning of their baniſhment, and the cauſe of thy long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to two faire Nymphes and a reuerend old man, whom thou ſhalt finde atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy comming in a great broad court before the Palace hall. <hi>Placindus</hi> to obey the ſage <hi>Felicias</hi> commaund, without any anſwer went to the place, where ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him. She that now had cauſed Lord <hi>Felix, Feliſmena, Syluanus,</hi> and
<hi>Seluagia, Danteus</hi> and <hi>Duarda,</hi> and the Nymphes to be all togither whiles ſhe was ſpeaking to <hi>Placindus,</hi> being gone to them, ſaid. Follow you me all. None then refuſing, went after her, and came where
<hi>Placindus, Stela,</hi> and <hi>Crimine</hi> were iuſt at that time that
<hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cindus</hi> began to tell his diſcourſe. To whom <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaid. Becauſe thou maiſt not want an auditorie for ſo noble a tale, behold my ſelfe that comes with my companie to take part of it: Wherefore let vs all ſit downe, and thou <hi>Placindus</hi> without any more courteſies, do that, which I did of late requeſt thee.</p>

<hi>Placindus,</hi> being place in the middes, began thus to ſay.</p>
               <p>Of the deſcent and famous pedegree of <hi>Eolus</hi> king of
<hi>Aeolia,</hi> (whom afterwards they called the God of the windes, and of whom that countrey tooke the name) ſprung out two illuſtrous houſes. Of the one a moſt mightie man called <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> was cheefe: The other a vertuous yoong Gentleman called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus,</hi> made moſt famous; who, though in poſſeſſions and reuenewes he was not
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:23115:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>equall to the other; yet in vertue, wherewith his minde was bountifully enriched, farre ſurpaſſed him. Betweene theſe two houſes was an ancient quarrell and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, by reaſon that neither of them would allow any equalitie, both ſtill conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for ſuperioritie, which to him that deſires to beare rule and command is a great and heauie burden. Truth it is, that in the time of theſe two principall men,
<hi>Disteus</hi> his partialitie went ſomewhat by the woorſe, bicauſe king <hi>Rotindus</hi> that then reigned, fauoured not a little the contrarie part, onely for that <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him ſo much in his bad conditions and diſorder of life. For both of them were proude, cruell, libidinous, enimies to vertue, and imbracers of all kinde of vice, whereunto
<hi>Diſteus</hi> was a mortall enimie: So that the king with continuall fauours enriched <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> and fauoured his followers, and with perpetuall hatred procured to impoueriſh <hi>Diſteus,</hi> and perſecute his friends. There were but fewe in the whole kingdome that for feare did not whatſoeuer <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> commanded, though they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in their mindes, and none that by their good wils would haue denied to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<hi>Disteus</hi> pleaſure in all things, who loued him deerely in their ſecret harts. So that they obeied <hi>Sagastes</hi> openly for reſpect of the king, and loued <hi>Diſteus</hi> ſecretly for his owne deſerts: Who yet with vertuous and ſincere loue was not a little ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured of
<hi>Dardanea Sagastes</hi> ſiſter, a yoong gentlewoman paſſing faire and rich, ſhe being alſo adorned with all thoſe gifts of nature, and minde, which onely enſtall that noble ſexe in immortal praiſes. For in her did euerie vertue ſhine as in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place. Her loue likewiſe to him was chaſte and pure, being onely grounded vpon <hi>Disteus</hi> his noble vertues, and ſingular goodnes, that was then the common ſubiect of euery mouth; whoſe loue though in her chaſte breaſt it was with all kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection entertained, yet might his comely perſonage &amp; goodly features haue well procured a wanton thought in the moſt modeſt minde. This noble Ladie had been married but three moneths to a knight of her own houſe (but in many degrees remooued) (called <hi>Fenubius</hi>) when <hi>Atropos</hi> before his iuſt time did cut off his vital thread, and in the flower of her age made her a yoong widow. Who bearing no ſmall affection to
<hi>Disteus</hi> when ſhe was a maide, would faine haue married him; but neither by words nor ſignes durſt once declare the leſt thought thereof vnto him, bicauſe ſhe would not for all the world tranſgreſſe the due limits of her honor and vertuos reputation; as alſo bicauſe ſhe thought it impoſſible to conclude a marriage in two ſuch contrarie houſes: Whereupon without more a doe ſhe was conſtrained to take ſuch a husband, as her brother did giue her (for her parents died when ſhe was but eight yeeres old) with whom ſhe liued ſo content (or at the leaſt fained it) as if ſhe had neuer thought of any other matter, a thing no leſſe beſeeming ſo braue a perſonage, as ſhe a moſt worthie example for them that take this honorable eſtate vpon them. <hi>Dardanea</hi> being therefore a widow, it fell out that <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> vpon a ſmall occaſion did (to her great griefe) put away her ſteward, who had beene an auncient ſeruitor, and well eſteemed of her parents, denying to pay him that, which was his due for his late ſeruice. In regard whereof, and for his other deſerts, this noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman did not onely ſatisfie
<hi>Anfilardus</hi> (for ſo he was called) but alſo beſtowed bountifull rewards vpon him, excuſing her ſelfe to him and ſaying, that his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was much againſt her will. There was not one in all the citie of
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> partie, that would giue him entertainment, bicauſe they would not offend ſo mightie a man: the which <hi>Anfilardus</hi> perceiuing, and how vniuſtly he was reiected, he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be with <hi>Disteus,</hi> whoſe fauour, bicauſe he deſerued no leſſe, as alſo bicauſe it was an honor to <hi>Diſteus</hi> to releeue <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> old ſeruants, he ſoone obtained. Though <pb n="332" facs="tcp:23115:170"/>yet on the ſudden ſo vnaduiſedly he entertained him not, without firſt taking his word and faith of a Gentleman, not to go from him againe, vpon no wrong, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie offered him. The which thing <hi>Diſteus</hi> thought good not to forget, bicauſe he might not (after he was placed with him) once offer to forſake him, thinking the diſgrace that reſulted to him by ſuch a departure would be greater, then the honour that he got by receiuing him. All this and more with ſolemne oath did <hi>Anfilardus</hi> auow; of whoſe word, as alſo of himſelfe (bicauſe he knew him well) <hi>Disteus</hi> made no ſmall reckoning. The which to accompliſh, <hi>Anfilardus</hi> neuer failed, though he had beene often moleſted to the contrarie. But before he came to dwell with <hi>Diſteus,</hi> he forgot not to aske <hi>Dardanea</hi> leaue, bicauſe he would not giue her any occaſion of diſcontent, if perhaps (by meanes thereof) ſhe felt any at all. But ſhe conſented the more willingly thereunto, when ſhe vnderſtood, that he was to be entertayned by <hi>Disteus:</hi> For as her brother could not chooſe but be offended thereat, ſo ſhe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoped, that he would worke the meanes to place him with her againe; But <hi>Anfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lardus</hi> told her not of the faith and promiſe that he had giuen <hi>Diſteus</hi> for his aboade and true ſeruice, which if ſhe had vnderſtood, ſhe would not (doubtleſſe) haue giuen him any ſuch leaue, knowing that
<hi>Anfilardus</hi> would not do any thing repugnant to his word and promiſe. It greeued not <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> a little to heare what the ſteward had done, knowing, that only he himſelf deſerued blame for it; but more, when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that neither faire entreaties, nor fierce threats could reclaime him to <hi>Dardaneas</hi> ſeruice. Who therefore perceiuing the remedie thereof impoſſible, bethought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of one more preiudiciall to him then any other, which was by giftes, and faire promiſes (or for that which afterwards fell out) to entice from <hi>Disteus,</hi> the woman whom he moſt tenderly loued, a nurſe of his (for from the teate ſhe had nurſed him and brought him vp) and an Aunte of mine called <hi>Palna,</hi> to beſtowe her on
<hi>Dardanea</hi> in lieu and recompence of her late departed ſtewarde: of which reuenge hee was ſo proud in minde (for hee had ſoone brought it to paſſe) that he thought he had done <hi>Diſteus</hi> the greateſt iniurie he coulde, by bereauing him of his nurſe, and beſides wounded his minde with greater greefe, then the ioy that he conceiued at
<hi>Anfilardus</hi> comming, whoſe fact made none to maruell much, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing well what great occaſion he had to doe it. But mine Auntes departure filled euery one full of woonder, thinking that ſhe had no iuſt cauſe to make her blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, but that ſhe was a woman, bicauſe <hi>Diſteus</hi> (as they all knew) rewarded euerie one ſo well, that there was not the meaneſt in his houſe, whom he iniuried, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified not, eſpecially
<hi>Palna,</hi> whom he loued aboue al the reſt, and honored as his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neuer knowing her by any other name. Which thing greeued him ſo much, that it made him almoſt beſides his wits: for firſt he would haue thought, that al the world woulde haue left him, before mine Aunt woulde haue forſaken him.
<hi>Disteus</hi> therefore being very ſadde and penſiue, and ſometimes complayning of his Aunt, <hi>Anfilardus</hi> came vnto him and began thus to ſay. If my perſon had not beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed (my good Lord and Maſter) for ſo deere a price, I had then great reaſon to be glad and vaunt, that I am the ſeruant to ſo woorthie a gentleman: but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that in the cauſe of my gladnes the effect of your ſadnes doth conſiſt, let my ioy be drowned with your diſcontent, and euer remaine ſo colde, that it may ſeeme rather dead, then liue without the ſight of your wiſhed good. I woulde it had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the immortall Gods, that I had neuer enioyed the perfect knowledge of your goodnes, bicauſe you might not then haue tried the vnkindnes of ingratefull <hi>Palna.</hi> I was maruelling at vnſtable fortune, that ſo on a ſudden deined to giue me <pb n="333" facs="tcp:23115:170"/>ſo ſweete a potion: but bicauſe ſhe woulde not haue me fall from the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that I euer had of her, ſhe by and by diſtempered it with a bitter taſte. Onely one thing comforts me, and ioyes my thoughts, that you (my Lord) ſhal know what difference there is betweene a man and woman, though I wiſh you had not tried it by this example. And though in truth you haue reaſon to bee ſorrie for <hi>Palnas</hi> change, yet you haue no cauſe to maruell at it, in that ſhe is a woman, which name the ancient writers, Philoſophers, Poets, and Painters did not vainely impoſe to Fortune. Pardon me (good ſir) if I am ſo bold with one, whom you loue ſo well, ſince I haue iuſt occaſion to do it, by reaſon of the great and greeuous charge that ſhe hath left me. For if I was then bound of mine owne ſelfe to obey you to my power, now by her occaſion I am conſtrained to ſerue you more then my forces can well attaine to. And if I being placed in your ſeruice, ſhee had remained ſtill, the little that I could do, might (perhaps) haue ſeemed ſomething; but ſhe going awaie for my cauſe (but not thorow my fault) for all that euer I can do, I ſhall be yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to more, being exchanged for her, whom you ſo greatly loued. And the worſt of all is, that if any thing (which not by my will, but by ſome negligence I may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) ſhall be open to the popular eie, it will be a common by-worde in all the citie, That it was a good exchange of <hi>Palna</hi> for <hi>Anfilardus.</hi> Wherefore I beſeech you my good Lord, that omitting this, you woulde accept of my good will, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent enough, if in my deedes there ſhall be any defect, and that my fault, which muſt needes proceed from my ſmall abilitie or ignorance, be not attributed but to the one or other. To this did
<hi>Diſteus</hi> anſwer thus. As I neither can nor will denie
<hi>(Anfilar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus)</hi> that I haue not greatly felt the ingratitude of my mother (<hi>Palna</hi> my nurſe I meane) by not thinking of that mutabilitie, which (thou ſaieſt) is naturally incident to women, by reaſon of the loue that I did alwaies beare her, and doe yet (to ſpeake the truth) which is not ſo little, that in ſo ſhort a time I may ſo eaſily forget the great iniurie, which I haue receiued at her vnkinde hands: So muſt I needs confeſſe, that it is a great lightening to my hart, that it was done for thy ſake, of whom I hope it ſhall be well conſidered, ſince the greater part thereof is alreadie requited with the good will, which at this preſent thou haſt diſcouered, though thy workes alſo haue ſeemed of no leſſe effect: both which (when opportunitie ſhall ſerue) I will not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after forget to reward. The beginning whereof ſhall be this, That I promiſe thee (bicauſe I perceiue how heauily thou takeſt the great greefe which I haue felt for her abſence) and ſweare neuer to ſhew my ſelfe agreeued for it in thy preſence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (perhaps) I be in minde, nor in thy abſence to impart it to any but to my ſelfe. They being in theſe ſpeeches, I came to <hi>Disteus</hi> houſe, and ſpeaking with one of his men, willed him to tell his Maſter, how I was come with a letter from mine Aunt vnto him. The page did my errant, and as <hi>Diſteus</hi> was in ſuſpence whether he might receiue it or no, <hi>Anfilardus</hi> ſaide vnto him: Sir, ſend for the meſſenger in, for by this you ſhall the more ſignifie your goodnes, hearing with one countenance the iuſt and culpable perſon, and not do <hi>Palna</hi> ſo much glorie as to make her know, that her abſence hath greeued you very much. <hi>Disteus</hi> liked his counſell well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon commanded me to come in. With thy good leaue (Lady <hi>Felicia</hi>) and of all the reſt, ſaid <hi>Pariſiles,</hi> I would aske how being without, you might heare theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches betweene them within. From hencefoorth anſwered <hi>Placindus,</hi> you muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that we tolde one another all the matters that paſſed, and with this aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement I will proceed. In the end I came in, where
<hi>Disteus</hi> and <hi>Anfilardus</hi> were, and doing my dutie, began thus to ſpeake. Your nurſe <hi>Palna</hi> with her remembred
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:23115:171"/>dutie to you (my Lord) doth moſt humblie beſeech you to reade this letter which ſhe ſends you. <hi>Disteus</hi> tooke the letter, and diſſembling his greefe, as <hi>Anfilardus</hi> had counſelled him, ſaid: If thine Aunt doth write to me to the ende to excuſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſhe needed not haue taken theſe paines, for ſhe might haue done heerein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her owne minde, as in that, which ſhall like me beſt, I will do to mine own will and pleaſure. Thou ſhalt tell her that I will reade it, wherein, if there be anie thing for me to do for her, I will heereafter bethinke me of it. I not perceiuing this kinde of diſſimulation, maruelled not a little to ſee how ſoone he had ſhaken off the loue that he bare to mine aunt. Truth it is, that as I was then ignorant of that, which afterwards ſucceeded, ſo I eſteemed his coye anſwere for a point of wiſedome, and was no leſſe aſhamed at that ſhe had done. With this anſwer I went my waies and they remained all alone. <hi>Anfilardus</hi> praiſed not a little his fained anſwere, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his wiſedome, in that he would not call her mother, as he was wont to do, nor name her by her owne name, in token of contempt. But <hi>Disteus</hi> opening the letter, ſaw it ſaid thus.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Diſteus</hi> had read the letter ſoftly to himſelf (for he would not read it aloud, before he had viewed the contents of it) he ſaid to <hi>Anfilardus.</hi> I would haue read this letter vnto thee
<hi>Anfilardus,</hi> if I had thought it would haue made thee glad or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; and alſo bicauſe it is ſo obſcurely written, that I can ſcarce vnderſtand one clauſe thereof. The contents of it perſwade me not to be carefull, nor trouble my wits by inquiring out the cauſe of her departure, vntill time doth manifeſt it, when as then (ſhe ſaieth) ſhe ſhall be as free from fault, as I from complaint. With this alſo ſhe
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:23115:171"/>writes me, that ſhe is content with <hi>Dardaneas</hi> ſeruice; for proofe whereof, ſhe extols her highly with onely two wordes, ſaying: That ſhe is the woonder of our age. She that is of ſuch excellent beautie (ſaide <hi>Anfilardus</hi>) enchaſed with all precious gems of vertue, deſerues no leſſe, aſſuring you Sir, that <hi>Palna</hi> (if with ſo much truth ſhe iuſtifies that which ſhe hath done, as ſhe hath reaſon for that ſhe hath ſpoken) may be blameles and excuſed to all the worlde: wherein I muſt needes ſay ſhe hath beene wiſe (hauing no good diſcharge and excuſe of her fault) by putting you in a doubtfull loue and hope of a thing you knowe not, to the ende that in (the meane while) you might forget and ouerpaſſe your anger by ſuch thoughts, and that ſhe might not neede heereafter to excuſe her-ſelfe. I told thee not long ſince (ſaide <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteus</hi>) that though I feele <hi>Palnas</hi> abſence very neere, yet I muſt diſſemble it with thee; by meanes whereof, happe good or ill, I will ſtill ſhewe one ſemblant, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that I know the cauſe of it, for indeed I could neuer perſwade my ſelfe, that this was no more but a dreame, ſince I had euer ſo great confidence in her loue and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie: Whereupon I thinke ſome iuſt cauſe muſt needes mooue her to doe it for my behoofe and benefit, as ſhe writes vnto me, which (though it were not ſo) I will not <hi>(Anfilardus)</hi> otherwiſe conceiue nor imagine. In that which toucheth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour you do me (ſaid
<hi>Anfilardus</hi>) by imparting to me the contents of the letter, I am bound to kiſſe your handes: And in the reſt, as in this, you ſhew (my Lord) your ſelfe what you are, and maintaine the title of your noble minde. In theſe and like ſpeeches they ſpent a pretie time, though <hi>Disteus</hi> ſometimes altered his talke, asking him of <hi>Dardaneas</hi> qualities, beautie, and wit; for he tooke a great delight to heare, that ſo many good parts in ſo high a degree were iointly found in one woman: which
<hi>Anfilardus</hi> did ſo brauely ſet forth, as one that knew them well, and to whom he was ſo much bound, that the eloquence of the golden mouthed Lord of <hi>Ithaca</hi> had beene needleſſe there. All which was to caſt an amorous and ſecret powder into <hi>Disteus</hi> foule, that he might thereafter haue been ſet on fire. On the other ſide, mine Aunt

<hi>Disteus</hi> his honorable diſpoſition and noble vertues, which ſhe ſo wiſely inſinuated, as if ſhe meant nothing leſſe then to praiſe him <hi>Diſteus</hi> now gaue leaue to his imaginations, to be only imploied in <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> beauty, ſo that he loued melancholy &amp; ſadnes, &amp; abandoned al ſports &amp; publick places. He now delighted only in ſolitarines, &amp; not only the company of ſtrangers, but of his own friends &amp; ſeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ats was troubleſom vnto him, who neuer ſuſpected that any amorous thought had ſo forcibly raigned in him: but rather attributed this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the greef that he had for <hi>Palnas</hi> abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which if they had not beleeued, they wuld not haue left to aske him the cauſe therof, though it had bin but in vaine, when he himſelf did ſcarce know it. <hi>Diſteus</hi> ſpent ſom daies in theſe conſiderations, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his fanſies being not meanly occupied, he vſed theſe words. O God, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe is it for thee (my mother) to tell me what reaſon thou hadſt to leaue me for this excellent Ladie. O ten times art thou happie, that haſt before thee (as often as thou wilt) the cleereſt mirrour of our times. Onely heerem, from this day foorth, I will not ceaſe to blame thee, for leauing me ſo late, if any fit occaſion had beene offered thee to defend thee with the ſhield of <hi>Dardaneas</hi> bountie and beautie, for both which all mortall men are bound to ſerue and obey her. Thou haſt ſoone per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thy word, that at length I ſhould ſee thy iuſt cauſe. Pardon therefore (good mother) my errour by reproouing thee, although the ſame (if thou doſt marke it well) was not my fault, but the great loue, that I did euer beare thee. But wretch <pb n="336" facs="tcp:23115:172"/>that I am, what haue I done by not anſwering thy wiſe and louing letter, and thriſe vnhappy mee, if thy nephew returned the ſharpe anſwere from the venemous mouth of thy vnwoorthy ſonne? Ah then thou ſhalt haue more reaſon to deteſt the vnfruitfull milke thou gaueſt him, then he had to condemne thee for thy iuſt departure, and with greater cauſe to curſe the vngratefull nouriture that thou haſt beſtowed on him, then he hath now to blame thy forced abſence. O <hi>Disteus,</hi> inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate youth, how raſh wert thou in anſwering <hi>Palna</hi> thy graue and wiſe mother, and how ill haſt thou deſerued to aduantage thy ſelfe by her gentlenes and helpe. And thus, thinking he had done a hainous offence by not anſwering her, in haſte he called for inke and paper, and going about to write, he was a good while in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and knew not how to begin: for faine he would haue ſhewed her how willing he was not onely to forgiue her, but alſo to haue craued pardon of her, both which he durſt not doe, neither was it wiſedome, before
<hi>Palna</hi> had cleerely made her iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And therefore he wrote in ſuch ſort, that my Aunt might take no offence thereat, and did what became him, the tenour whereof was this.</p>

By and by after I had read thy letter, I would haue ſetled my ſelfe to this taske, wherein I had ſo many contraries of (I) and (no) that not knowing what to determine, or to which of both to adhere, I haue till now ſuſpended it. If the loue I beare thee, did ſollicite me to do it; the anger thou gaueſt me did forbid it.

                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:23115:172"/>After he had written this letter, he cauſed me to be ſought out in all haſte, and, being come before him, requeſted me to carie it foorthwith to mine Aunt. The ioy was not ſmall that ſhee receiued with the letter that came to her from her ſonne
<hi>Disteus,</hi> although it was to her confuſion and ſhame: For ſhe that doth perfectly loue, deſires (though it be to her owne harme) to ſee the things of her beloued; but ſhe was a great deale gladder, when ſhe ſawe with what mildneſſe and humanitie it was written. The ſolitarie life that <hi>Diſteus</hi> (as I told you) did ſo much loue and leade, was now growen to ſuch a ſeconde nature, that all companie was irkeſome vnto him, but onely <hi>Anfilardus,</hi> as well for that it was repreſented to his thoughtes, that he had beene <hi>Dardaneas</hi> ſeruant, as alſo bicauſe he euer anſwered ſincerely to his purpoſe, by telling him continually of her ſoueraigne graces. This kinde of ſadde and priuate liſe of <hi>Diſteus</hi> came to the eares of his beloued <hi>Palna,</hi> which greeued her not a little, thinking that it was onely for her abſence: for remedie whereof ſhe wrote him a letter, wherein ſhe accuſed him of want of faith, ſince he fulfilled not his promiſe, which was, Not to entertaine nor make any ſhew of greefe, vntill he knewe the cauſe of her departure; and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him by all poſſible meanes to ſhake off all that ſadnes, by the exerciſe of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in armes and courtly ſports, as he was woont to do. <hi>Disteus</hi> anſwered her again, proteſting with ſolemne oath that he was rather glad ſhe was with
<hi>Dardanea,</hi> from whence (he ſaid) the cauſe of his ſollitarines did not proceed; but that, without kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the reaſon thereof, he found himſelfe more altered in minde then he was wont to be, after he had receiued her firſt letter, and had heard her name <hi>Dardanea;</hi> &amp; that on the one ſide he delighted in hearing it, and on the other (not knowing the cauſe) trembled when he heard it: in the end he requeſted her, if ſhe woulde euer doe him any pleaſure, to work the means that he might ſee
<hi>Dardanea,</hi> for though he had ſeen her when ſhe was a maide, yet was it not as it ſhould be, according to the great and renowned fame that now was bruted of her. All this that he wrote to her, was her great ioy, ſeeing how he drew towards the end, that ſhe pretended: but it troubled hir mind not a little to thinke how ſhe might ſatisfie <hi>Diſteus</hi> (though it was her only deſire to ſhew him faire <hi>Dardanea</hi>) bicauſe ſhe found no fit opportunity by reaſon of her regular modeſtie and priuate life. The daily care and ſtudie that both of them had to bring this to effect, diſcouered a ſecret way to put both their deſires in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, which was, that on a night (whereon they had agreed bicauſe it might bee the more ſecret) if any fit occaſion or opportunitie were offered, mine Aunte ſhoulde ſend for me, as though ſhe had ſome buſines for me; and that
<hi>Diſteus</hi> in my apparell ſhould go in my ſteede, whereof they both aduiſed me, feining that it was onely to goe ſee mine Aunt, who woulde not yet truſt me with ſuch ſecret affaires. Mine Aunt ſtaied certaine daies, before ſhe tooke this buſines in hand, though opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie was many times offered, and deferred the time ſo long, that he began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine on her, and thought that all were but words and promiſes (for hee that with earneſt deſire is attending that whereon his minde doth euer runne, doth hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue any thing) though indeede it was not ſo: who (pondering the matter well) ſhould haue rather conſidered, that ſome great obſtacle occurred in her minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the performance of his requeſt, which made ſuch a ſtop in the meanes and furtherance of it, that holding her for a great while in ſuſpence, ſhe knewe not what to do. And this it was, that if <hi>Diſteus</hi> on the ſudden had ſeene faire <hi>Dardanea,</hi> the firſt ſight of that excellent beautie, &amp; the extreme ioy thereof might haue cauſed ſome ſudden alteration and traunce in him, to haue made
<hi>Dardanea</hi> ſuſpect ſomething: <pb n="338" facs="tcp:23115:173"/>which mine Aunt would not for all the worlde had hapned, leaſt her Miſtres might haue taken ſome diſpleaſure at them both, which thing made not a little for their good beginning. But as mine Aunt was very diſcreet and wiſe, ſo did ſhe obuiate this doubt with a ſudden remedie; for to preuent any ſuch extreme paſſion, that by ſuch a ſight and ioy hemight haue had, ſhe thought to moderate it with ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thought of no leſſe greefe and ſorrow. And thus it was, that now performing that that was agreed vpon betweene them, he ſhould come when the night began to waxe ſomewhat darke in my apparell; but ſending for him in my name, ſhe fained that it was to go for a Chirurgian to heale <hi>Dardaneas</hi> arme, the which by opening a great cheſt, the lidde by chance fell downe on, and bruſed very much. The greefe that he conceiued by theſe heauie news, was ſo great, that he would now haue chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ioy that he expected by <hi>Dardaneas</hi> ſight, in lieu that this miſchance had not happened vnto her. For he felt it ſo ſenſibly, that he had almoſt no hart to goe, but yet encouraged himſelfe, leaſt I might haue perceiued it: and ſo hiding his greefe the beſt he could, he left off his garments, and putting on mine, went ſtraight to <hi>Darda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> houſe. Where, without knocking at the doore (for ſo he was willed to doe) he went vp (as I was woont) into a broad chamber that was next to <hi>Dardaneas</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing chamber, where he no ſooner knocked, but a waiting maide comming to the doore, but not to the place where he ſtoode, went backe againe, and told mine Aunt that I was there, who willed her to bid me come in, for ſo had hir Miſtreſſe commaunded, and true it was indeed. Bicauſe you may therefore vnderſtand wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Dardanea</hi> would haue in ployed me, you muſt know, that <hi>Sagastes</hi> her brother was in loue with a yoong Gentlewoman well deſcended and rich enough (called
<hi>Marthea</hi>) but ſhe requited him not with like againe, for his bad conditions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable pride; and alſo becauſe ſhee was more affected to another Gentleman, though not ſo rich nor ſo highly borne in reſpect of him; but one that was vertuous, noble, and valiant, and of whom ſhe was truely beloued and ſerued againe. But yet for all this ſhe ſhewed <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> a good countenance in recompence of the great and continual ſeruices that he had done hir: <hi>For how much doth not intereſt &amp; gifts preuaile, which are the onely tamers of affections?</hi> So that being glad to be ſerued by ſo mightie a man, and bicauſe it is the faſhion of women to glorie in themſelues by ſeeing men howſoeuer (they care not) appaſſionate for them, ſhe gaue him as many ſuperficiall fauours as he deſired, and more indeed, then her honour required. Wherein
<hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi> taking no little pride, beleeued that ſhe loued him from her verie hart. The which opinion confirming in his breaſt with this alſo, That he was in fauour with the King, of great authoritie in the citie, and more nobly borne, and richer then her parents; thought that at the verie inſtant when he purpoſed to demaund her for his wife, he ſhould not haue any deniall: Whereupon he did aske her Fathers good will, who thanked him for his, and for his part gaue his conſent, but alleaging that it was not amiſſe to leaue ſome part to his wife and daughter. Whereat <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> like a proud and diſdainfull man by his angrie countenance ſhewed ſome impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who would not haue had the matter deferred any longer. But the loue that he bare <hi>Marthea,</hi> did ſo bridle it, that (contrarie to his naturall and woonted inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) it pacified him well at that time: And therefore anſwered, that it was well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. This marriage pleaſed
<hi>Martheas</hi> mother well, to ſee her daughter ſo highly aduanced (a propertie moſt naturall to the ambitious and couetous mindes of women) but diſliked <hi>Marthea</hi> altogither, for that which is aboueſaid. Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them, that as ſhe was their daughter, and thereby bound to obey their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; <pb n="339" facs="tcp:23115:173"/>ſo they ſhould haue good regard to that they did, &amp; for ſo weightie a matter as this, craue ſome time and reſpit of <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> wherein they might determine with due conſideration what was beſt to be done, and that then ſhe would giue them her anſwer of the matter. And bicauſe <hi>Sagastes</hi> in the meane time might not thinke himſelfe diſgraced while they were concluding this matter, to tell him that ſhe was reſolued firſt to make an end of certaine Pilgrimages and deuotions, which ſhe had of late begun, and ſo in the meane time to feed him with hope, whereby he might not thinke himſelfe agreeued for ſtaying ſo long. This reſpit of time <hi>Marthea</hi> took to trie, if in the end ſhe could diſpoſe her thoughts to loue <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> and forget her beloued <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> (for ſo was the Gentleman called, who ſerued her, and whom ſhe loued.) And <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> was well content, ſince that her parents had left the concluſion of the matter to
<hi>Marthea,</hi> in whom he had placed his libertie. She with the conſent of her parents (not giuing him to vnderſtand any ſuch matter) ſpake vnto him, as often as he would, but fayning that ſhe did it by ſtealth. But as
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> euerie day, &amp; more by night walked vp and downe before her doore, <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> could not chooſe but perceiue it <hi>(for what doth not a true louer ſuſpect and finde out)</hi> and this he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the cold affection that <hi>Marthea</hi> had ſhewed him of late. Whereupon wrath and iealouſie ſeiſing vpon his hart at once, he reſolued to be well reuenged of him, though it coſt him his life; and therefore certaine nights togither lay in ſecret waite for him, accompanied with his brother and three of his coſins, all three ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men to defend him in any broile. And though ſometimes they met him, yet they durſt not aſſault him, not for feare, but bicauſe there was euer ſo much people in the ſtreetes, that if they had killed or wounded him, they had ſuffered (if it had beene knowen) no leſſe then cruell death: So that they onely attended fit time and opportunitie to do it to their owne ſaſetie. By ſome of <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> ſeruants, it came to faire
<hi>Dardaneas</hi> eares, that her brother vſed not to ſtay at home in the nights, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon incited with deſire and feare, ſhe would faine know wither he went: And talking with mine Aunt <hi>Palna</hi> her nurſe about this matter, thought that there were no better meanes to know it, then by my ſecret diligence to ſpie him out. <hi>Dardanea</hi> therefore for this purpoſe commaunded mine Aunt to ſend for me: and bicauſe
<hi>Diſteus</hi> might haue a ſight of <hi>Dardanea,</hi> ſhe cauſed him to come thither in my name. I left you (if I remember) when they bad me come in, or elſe <hi>Diſteus</hi> (to ſay better) diſguiſed like me. Mine Aunt being well aduiſed in euerie thing ſhe tooke in hand, a little before <hi>Disteus</hi> came in, as if ſhe had nothing to doe, did ſet the candle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Miſtreſſe for two cauſes: The one, by the oppoſite brightnes of the light, to dazle <hi>Dardaneas</hi> eies, bicauſe ſhee might not knowe <hi>Disteus;</hi> and the other, to ſhewe <hi>Disteus</hi> the more light whereby hee might beholde <hi>Dardanea</hi> better. Hee was nowe come in (and if ioyfull to ſee her, or ſorrowfull for her miſhap I knowe not) when the bright reflexion of her faire face ſmit againſt his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die eies, wherewith he was not onely amazed, but knew that her beautie was greater then the report that was ſpred abroad if it, and that Fame had iniuried her by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing it leſſe, then it was indeede: which not onely hee (in fauour of his affection) but any other (free from like paſſion) might eaſily haue iudged. And without all doubt he had beene in danger of ſome ſudden extaſie, if his minde had not ſtill run on her miſchance, that mine Aunt had ſeyned: who, thinking that he had now ſeen her enough, which ſo much he deſired, came to him ſpeaking ſomewhat aloude, to hold him ſtill in that opinion, ſaying. <hi>Placindus,</hi> my Lady muſt employ you about her buſines, and therefore commands thee to go thy waies: And ſo of purpoſe ſhe came <pb n="340" facs="tcp:23115:174"/>to <hi>Diſteus,</hi> to ſpeake with him alone. In good faith (ſaide <hi>Pariſiles</hi>) the comming of <hi>Palna</hi> to <hi>Diſteus</hi> was very pretie, for I was nowe halfe ſorrie with my ſelfe, not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what <hi>Palna</hi> would haue ſaid, when he ſpake aloud, that both might haue heard. For
<hi>Dardanea</hi> knew that ſhe would ſend him to ſpie out
<hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> and <hi>Diſteus</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that it was to go for a Chirurgian. And ſo with great diſcretion ſhe ſpake that out aloud, which anſwered both their intents, in that he was ſent to goe his waies, and ſo to deceiue them both by theſe means. <hi>Dardanea,</hi> bicauſe ſhe might not know, that it was <hi>Diſteus;</hi> and <hi>Diſteus,</hi> bicauſe he might not then ſinell out the deceit that <hi>Palna</hi> vſed with him, by making him beleeue, that <hi>Dardanea</hi> was hurt: but ſhe came to him (hauing told him that <hi>Dardanea</hi> bad him go his waies) fit to the purpoſe, for then if he had paſſed further, his ſpeech might haue marred all the matter, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the fine deceit. Truly (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) ſhe muſt needs be wiſe in althings, and well ſhe manifeſted the ſame by ſetting the candle before <hi>Dardanea.</hi> For theſe fauourable notes, Gentlemen, which by the way you haue gathered of mine Aunt, to confirme them (ſaide <hi>Placindus</hi>) I giue you my word, that ſhe was accounted for ſuch an one; and bicauſe I am her kinſman, I hold my peace, concerning that which might be ſpoken more in her praiſe, and alſo bicauſe by the proceſſe of my tale you ſhall ſee it. To proceede therefore: As ſhe came neere to <hi>Diſteus,</hi> turning to
<hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danea,</hi> ſhe ſaid, Do you command him any other ſeruice, and I will tel it him: No, ſaid <hi>Dardanea,</hi> but he ſhall do me a pleaſure if heerein he doe his diligence. Mine Aunt then tooke
<hi>Diſteus</hi> by the hande to bring him foorth, whereat hee ſeemed to make ſome ſmall reſiſtance, vnlooſing his hand from hers, as though he woulde haue put on his cloake that fell downe: which when mine Aunt perceiued, with an angrie countenance, ſhe ſaide ſoftly vnto him. You ſhall come no more hither I promiſe you. Who hearing her ſharpe threatning, with the teares in his eies, anſwered. Pardon (good mother) the body, that is loath to depart from the ſoule: whereupon they went out, and mine Aunt went talking with him, and asked him, if he was nowe cleered of the fault, that ſhe made by her departure. Whereunto he anſwered not a word, for by contemplating of that ſoueraigne beautie, he was ſo much diſtraught in minde, that he heard not what ſhe ſaid. But afterwardes being come to himſelfe againe, with a profound ſigh he ſaid. O what ſhall become of thee <hi>Disteus:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he helde his peace. She blamed him for this ſpeech, and reprooued him for that he had done, telling him plainly, that theſe were not the meanes to deliuer him from his paſſions. Some ſpeeches being paſt betweene them, ſhe opened vnto him the whole deceit, which ſhe had fayned of her Miſtreſſe breaking off her arme, and why ſhe did it, and telling him all, euen to that point, when I, or rather he, was ſent foorth, ſhe ſaid. You muſt now therefore, bicauſe my miſtreſſe <hi>Dardanea</hi> commands this to be done, go by and by to your lodging, and giue my coſin his garments, and tell him what I ſaid to you, that <hi>Dardanea</hi> doth pray him (not making mention of any other matter) and I cammaund him to goe about his errant with all diligence. But <hi>Diſteus</hi> aunſwered, God neuer graunt, that another fulfill that which was commaunded me. In mine owne perſon I will doe that, which my Miſtreſſe commaunded mee, being but diſguiſed and counterfeit: Doe as you thinke good, ſaide mine Aunt, but in ſuch ſort that it may bee thought that my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nephew did it. Leaue that to me, ſaid he, and take you care for the reſt: And with this they tooke their leaue of one another. He went ſtraight to his houſe, where he found me waiting for him, and ſaid vnto me. Heere thou maieſt ſafely ſtay <hi>Placin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> this night, for I will go walke a little vp and downe the citie, and weare thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:23115:174"/>And though thine Aunt commands thee to goe of an errant, which ſhe gaue me in charge to tell thee, bicauſe my waie lies thereabouts, I will my ſelfe do it. And bicauſe thou maieſt not be found with my garments on, if any come to ſeeke me, thou ſhalt locke thy ſelfe in: for I will bid my ſeruants (if any aske for me) ſaie that I am a ſleepe, and open the dore to no bodie, vnleſſe hee ſay he is <hi>Placindus,</hi> bicauſe when I come they may then let mee in. With this aduiſe that hee gaue me, he went into an inward chamber and tooke a buckler, and a good broad ſword, (that many daies ſince was hung vp againſt the wall, bicauſe it was ſomewhat too heauie for his hand, though now <hi>Dardaneas</hi> loue had added more ſtrength &amp; force to his arme) &amp; did put on a ſhirt of maile, &amp; a good head-peece. Being thus armed, he went to looke when
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> came forth, and in this ſort went, leaſt in the night any harme might haue hapned vnto him. When hee came to <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> houſe, hee heard a tuning of certaine inſtruments, for it fell out that hee went that night to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe ſome muſicke on his Miſtres

<hi>Fortune.</hi> It came to one that vſed election; for it lay in his choice to digge, which he might haue left vndone if he would, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering beſides howe finding of treaſure doth ſeldome happen. It muſt be called good
<hi>Fortune,</hi> if the effect be good, as finding of treaſure; ill, if the effect be naught, as when he found treaſure, he found a viper that bit him. It may be called great, if the effect be great; little, if the effect be little. Whereupon it may begathered for our purpoſe or intent (for they vſe all in one ſignification for this preſent diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that it may be called <hi>Fortune.</hi> So that in fooles and children, that haue no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, there is no <hi>Fortune.</hi> Whereupon you ſhall vnderſtand, that if the ſtone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they make the aulters, or the woode, whereof they make the ſtatues of the Gods, they poetically call Fortunate, it is by a figure called <hi>Metaphora,</hi> or likenes, that thoſe ſtones and woode hath in reſpect of others with fortunate men, and thoſe which are not. But there is one thing to be noted, that inſenſible things participate of
<hi>Fortune</hi> paſſiuely, as obiects, by meanes whereof men are fortunate.</p>
               <p>Giue it me againe (ſaid <hi>Placindus</hi> to Lord
<hi>Felix</hi>) for you go too far, that which is read is ſufficient for the vnderſtanding of the foreſaid verſes. Truely (ſaid
<hi>Pariſiles</hi>) it is learnedly handled, and I thinke that the point which Lord <hi>Felix</hi> deſired to know, is ſufficiently vnderſtoode, and that he cleerely ſhewed it by that which he read, conſidering the obſcuritie of the matter. I am ſatisfied (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) but I ſhould take great pleaſure, if now the ſence of the verſe (taken with the intent) were quadrant to my minde. I am content (ſaid <hi>Placindus</hi>) to tell it. Hauing ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (if you remember) that whoſoeuer ſpeaketh ill of <hi>Fortune</hi> was a foole, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to his reaſons, he prooues himſelfe to haue no reaſon, whereupon that it is inferred in that ſtaffe which you aske, that ſince they haue no reaſon at that time, when one entreates of <hi>Fortune,</hi> it is not meete to talke with them, nor they to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle <pb n="346" facs="tcp:23115:177"/>with things of <hi>Fortune, Since Fortune onely commeth to him that hath reaſon.</hi> Nowe that I am reſolued (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) returne to your Hiſtorie againe. You made an end in telling how <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> had interrupted the muſicke, leauing his brother and coſens in the reregard: I brake it off at this worde <hi>Distcus that now.</hi> And ſince I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted your continued diſcourſe, it is reaſon that I helpe you to knit it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to it againe. Well then from that place I will begin, ſaid <hi>Placindus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Disteus,</hi> that now had come ſomewhat neere, deſirous to taſte of that dainty mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, euen then when he ſaw violent hands laid on <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> (although he hated him mortally, yet to do his Lady
<hi>Dardanea</hi> ſeruice) he ranne in, and ſtept betweene
<hi>Eel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daniſus</hi> and <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> (for he had now alſo drawne his ſword) ſaying. Keepe out Lord <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> and receiue this ſmall peece of ſeruice for my Miſtres <hi>Dardanea</hi> your ſiſters ſake. <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> was ſo wroth to ſee <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> taken away, that like an angrie Beare deſpoiled of her yoong ones, with enraged furie he ran vpon <hi>Diſteus,</hi> to wreake his anger wholly vpon him; and thinking he had beene but of ſmall courage, and partly incenſed with violent deſpite and choler, without any feare he ranne within him, and lifting vp his ſworde with all his ſtrength did manfully diſcharge it vpon him. But <hi>Diſteus</hi> like a ſtout and couragious Gentleman, knowing it was no time to dally when he ſawe ſuch a furious blowe comming, before it was diſcharged, by cloſing with him tooke it vpon his buckler, wherewith he thumped him ſo ſtrongly on the breſt, that he felled him to the ground; where, hauing knocked his head by the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fall, he lay ſenceles for a ſpace, and was not able to riſe vp againe.
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> and his page would haue come in to helpe
<hi>Diſteus,</hi> but that <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> brother, and his coſens ſeeing ſwordes drawne in <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> fauour, two of them fell vpon
<hi>Diſteus,</hi> thinking it had beene <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> with intent to haue made but a ſhort peece of worke of it, bicauſe they could not ſtay long about that buſines (for ſo the fower had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betweene them) and the other two fell vpon <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> and his page, whom they thought to be <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> men. But it fell out cleane contrarie, and in vaine came they in ſo ſoone, for <hi>Diſteus</hi> had now ſmitten
<hi>Beldaniſus</hi> to the grounde, where his brother ſeeing him lie, without a worde, thought verily that he was ſlaine. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determining either to die, or to reuenge his death, with one of his coſens he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed <hi>Diſteus:</hi> who without any ſigne of feare or cowardiſe manfully receiued them both. But yet he ſawe him ſelfe narrowly beſet, bicauſe they were both hardy youths; beſides that the wrath and deſire of reuenge, to ſee <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> on the ground, made them deſperate. But they were not able to controll <hi>Diſteus</hi> his courage, nor to abate his ſtrength and dexteritie, that had by this time wearied them, and ended their liues, if they had not bin wel armed with defences. But when at his pleaſure he lifted vp his good ſworde to ſmite one of them, he did ſo hardly entreate them, that they thought it beſt not to come within his reach, wherewith he had nowe broken their maile, and wounded them lightly in ſome places. The two coſens made <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> and his page flie before them, and had killed them, if they thought <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> had beene there, being alſo ignorant in what caſe <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> and his coſens were. But nowe when <hi>Disteus</hi> had brought them to an ill paſſe, <hi>Beldaniſus</hi> came to himſelfe againe, (for he had no other harme, but that onely by the blowe in his head he had loſt his ſence) and knowing what a great ſhame and diſhonour it was vnto him, and ſeeing beſides how valiantly the man that came in betweene them, had behaued himſelfe with two of them, he fell fiercely vpon him, of purpoſe to take iuſt reuenge of him, aſſailing him more aduiſedly then before.
<hi>Diſteus</hi> though he ſawe himſelfe encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by three, did not yet looſe his manly courage, but as if the effray had but then
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:23115:177"/>begun, wounded them cruelly, not eſcaping himſelfe without ſome ſmall wounds &amp; cuts in his garments, bicauſe their ſwordes did not cut like his, nor their armes had the ſtrength as his had; the cheefeſt cauſe whereof was, that <hi>Diſteus</hi> did not let them wound him at their pleaſure: albeit one of the coſins did put him to much trouble: For as two of them did ſet him well a worke, he with a long tucke did thruſt at him mortall ſtocados, wherupon <hi>Disteus</hi> thinking that all the victory conſiſted by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming him, he endeuoured to cloſe with him; for he perceiued wel, that if he had thruſt but one to his minde, it had beene ynough for him. But the other two percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his intent, preuented him of his purpoſe; whereupon the other in the meane time reached him a deſperate thruſt, the which with a ready eie auoyding, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſuch a ſturdie blowe, that he felled him to the ground: And to
<hi>Beldaniſus,</hi> who had wounded him in the ſhoulder, without any pauſe at all he gaue an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart blowe on the left arme, that he cut the maile from his ſleeue, and the fleſh to the bone. With theſe two blowes they were put in ſuch a feare, that they thought it beſt to giue backe, ſtudying rather to defend themſelues, then offend or hurt their enemie.
<hi>Diſteus</hi> ſeeing the victorie in his hands, did not ceaſe to plie them ſtill in ſuch ſort, that he made them by one and one retire. But now by this time there was much people gathered togither, to part the effray, though by the darknes of the night one knew not another. Whereupon
<hi>Diſteus,</hi> taking vp his cloke, that he had caſt downe, got himſelfe out of the preaſe: and <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> to ſeeke the man out, that had helped him ſo well in that encounter, cared not to purſue his enemies, ſo that they eſcaped then away vnknowen, without getting any thing of their purpoſe. <hi>Disteus</hi> perceiuing, that with ſo great deſire they ſought him, to doe his feate the better, and that which heereafter you ſhall heare, came to <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> page, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a corner of his bandkercher in his mouth, bicauſe he would not be knowen by his ſpeech, ſaid vnto him. Let not thy Maſter take any care to knowe who I am, for to morrow I will goe my ſelfe to kiſſe his handes. The page went with this errant, but <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> not content therewith, would haue gone himſelfe to haue ſpoken with him, if the page had not diſſwaded him, ſaying. Sir, it is no reaſon to moleſt him, that hath done you no leſſe a good turne, then the ſauing of your life. It ſeemes he would not now be willingly knowne, let him therefore alone and trouble him not, ſince he hath giuen you his word to come to morrow and viſit you. Thou ſaieſt well (ſaide <hi>Sagaſtes</hi>) and till then I ſhall not be quiet in minde: for it hath put me in a great wonder and confuſion to knowe who he might be, that ſo valiantly defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt three; but in a greater, when I call to minde the wordes that he ſpake, when he ſtept in to helpe me, That I ſhould take it for a peece of ſeruice due to my ſiſter and his Miſtreſſe <hi>Dardanea.</hi> For they were ſuch, that (had I not knowen <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danea</hi> well) would haue put me in a great ſuſpicion and iealouſie of her. And beſides this, it comes alſo to my minde that if he be wounded (for he could not otherwiſe eſcape) it ſhall be ill beſeeming me, if I doe not the beſt I can to procure his health and reuenge, although by the laſt he hath ſufficiently accuited himſelfe. Go tell him therefore from me what my deſire and good will is towardes him, and that (before he be gone in haſte to helpe himſelfe) I will not depart from this place. The page went, and being come to <hi>Diſteus</hi> ſpake thus vnto him. Sir, whoſoeuer you be, my Lord <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> doth kiſſe your hands, and by me giues you to vnderſtand, that he praies the Gods may graunt him but the leſt occaſion and opportunity to ſerue you in any thing he may, and to requite the great good turne, which he hath this night receiued at your hands; who would haue come in perſon himſelfe to thanke you, but <pb n="348" facs="tcp:23115:178"/>that the vnderſtands it is your deſire to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale your ſelfe. He is alſo no leſſe deſirous to know who you are, but he is loth to intreat you to any thing againſt your will, leſt perhaps, you would deny to do that you ſhal think good, although you haue forced him to be euer bound vnto you. But for all this he would vrge and oblige you to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill your promiſe, to ſee him to morrow according to your word. He praies you more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer to looke wel to your ſelfe, if you be wounded, and to take ſome ſpeedy order for your ſafetie, ſaying, that vntill he ſee you go hence, he will not depart from the place where he is. Tell thy Lord, anſwered <hi>Disteus,</hi> that if I haue done any thing for him, it was no more but a due debt which I owe him, onely for that he is brother to my Miſtreſſe <hi>Dardanea:</hi> and bicauſe he may not be greeued in minde by not knowing who I am, tell him that I am <hi>Placindus,</hi> nephew to
<hi>Palna,</hi> free from wounds, and I muſt needs ſtay here all alone about certaine buſines that I haue agreed vpon, and that therefore he may depart, ſince I am greeued in nothing, wherein his care may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile me, aſſuring him that to morrow I will ſtand to my word and promiſe. The Page maruelled much that I had ſo valiantly helped his Lord and him, and as he eſteemed me in his mind for a tall man: ſo thought me to be ill brought vp by giuing him ſo rude an anſwere. For <hi>Diſteus</hi> of purpoſe would not anſwere him with more humanitie, though he could do it well, bicauſe there was no cauſe as I told you to vſe him well, but onely that he was brother to her, that was his onely ioy. But the page thinking it proceeded of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; want of good education, mended (I think) the matter with his Lord touching my homely anſwer. <hi>Sagastes</hi> woondred (and not without great reaſon) when he heard that it was I, that had ſo manfully taken his part, and with that falſe opinion which from that time he had of my valour, he went home, thinking ſtil it was I, by whom he receiued ſo great a benefit. <hi>Diſteus</hi> alſo when he ſaw <hi>Sagastes</hi> gone, went home to his own houſe, where he found me with fear for his long tarying, &amp; carefully attending his returne. But when I ſaw him ſo ill entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I began to chaunge colour, thinking he had beene hurt, and therefore ſaid vnto him. What meanes this Sir? How come you home in this ſort? Trouble not thy ſelfe, ſaid <hi>Disteus,</hi> for I haue no hurt: and now that thou haſt ſeene, how in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell (becauſe I would not be knowen in <hi>Dardaneas</hi> houſe) I went to ſee thine Aunt and my mother: So I alſo told thee that thine Aunt was to ſend thee of an errant, the which bicauſe it lay in my way, I would alſo diſpatch. The errant therefore that <hi>Dardanea</hi> did will thee to do was this: But giue good eare, and looſe not a word of that, which I will tell thee, bicauſe it behooues thee much, and alſo bicauſe we may not both be taken in a lye. I ſay <hi>Dardanea</hi> requeſted thee to goe watch her brother, who (as it was told her) was accuſtomed to goe night by night out of his houſe, and to ſee whither he went. But it fell out, that this night my ſelfe doing that, which was committed to thy charge, after a good while that <hi>Sagastes</hi> came foorth, I followed him, and after this he told me particularly all the ſucceſſe, as you haue now heard, and ſomewhat more. When I heard of the ſingular fauour and helpe that <hi>Disteus</hi> had done to
<hi>Sagastes,</hi> I was aſtoniſhed to ſee that with ſo great zeale and courage he had ſuccoured him, who was his mortall enemie, and therefore ſaide vnto him. You haue filled me Sir full of woonder, for it is beyond all ſence and conceit that you ſhould be mooued to put your life in danger for one, that would bereaue you of yours. Stay (ſaid <hi>Disteus</hi>) and hearken how the matter fals out, &amp; thou ſhalt know the whole cauſe, whereby thou ſhalt vnderſtand how much thou art beholding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. Thou muſt therfore know that to heare the muſick the better (as I told thee) I came ſomwhat neere, thinking that by wearing thy apparell, I might not haue been <pb n="349" facs="tcp:23115:178"/>knowen, and bicauſe <hi>Dardanea</hi> might not thinke of thee the worſe, that being preſent there, thou didſt not helpe her brother in ſo great danger, I thought good not for any loue I bare him (whom I would rather haue purſued to death, then to defende him from it) but for thy ſake <hi>Placindus,</hi> to put my perſon in hazard. And therefore bicauſe it might bee thought, that thou wert the man that came to helpe him, when I ſtept in before him, I ſaide: Accept this ſmall token of good will Lord <hi>Sagastes</hi> for my Miſtreſſe <hi>Dardaneas</hi> ſake, your vertuous ſiſter. And now therefore that thou knoweſt how al hath hapned, and that I charged thee not to forget the leaſt part thereof, giue eare to the end, whereunto this particular diſcourſe of mine is adreſſed. To morrowe thou ſhalt goe to my mother and carrie her a letter from me, and tell her what thou haſt done, touching that buſines which ſhe had giuen thee in charge, wherein all the whole matter ſhall conſiſt. Firſt, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe may aduiſe thee howe to behaue thy ſelfe with
<hi>Dardanea,</hi> and with anie other that perhaps may aske thee howe this matter paſſed. Secondly, bicauſe ſhe may ſet downe ſome good order for that which is needfull to be done. After this, thou ſhalt go and ſpeake with <hi>Sagastes,</hi> to ſtand to thy word (or rather mine to ſaie better) where, (as thine Aunt ſhall inſtruct thee, and as I haue aduiſed thee) thou ſhalt ſpeake vnto him. Thou ſhalt alſo carrie this ſword with thee, bicauſe I thinke he will aske for it, for the good proofe that it made on the rapiers and daggers there. If he would know where thou hadſt it, tell him that when thine Aunt was with me, I gaue it thee, and ſo I am ſure hee will beſtow ſome ſuites of apparell on thee in recompence of thine which were ſpoiled and defaced in his defence. But thou muſt do me ſo much pleaſure, not to take them at his hands, but rather tell him, that thou careſt not for any other recompence, then that thou didſt it for
<hi>Dardane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> ſeruice, being Miſtres to thine Aunt. In doing whereof, thou ſhalt not onelie binde me, to beſtow this, and more on thee, but alſo her (when ſhe ſhall know howe thou didſt aduenture thy life for her ſake) to requite this good turne, and euer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to make more account of thy manhood and fidelitie: And, by denying to take any reward at
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> hands, oblige her moreouer to thine Aunt. The next daie in the morning I carried the letter that <hi>Disteus</hi> had written that night to mine Aunt, and told her all that had paſſed.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Placindus</hi> went on thus telling the pleaſant diſcourſe of <hi>Diſteus</hi> and <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daneas</hi> loues, they all bent their cares to a certaine noiſe that a horſe and his Maſter made, he to take him that ran vp and downe without his bridle, and the horſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be caught, bicauſe he liked his libertie better. Which when
<hi>Placindus</hi> ſaw, with a merrie countenance he aroſeland ſaid. I beſeech you ſage Lady, and noble companie, pardon me, for it ſhall ill become me if I goe not to helpe that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to get his horſe againe. And without more adoe he went and left them all laughing, and ſomewhat greeued to ſee how abruptly he left them for ſo ſmall a matter. To whom
<hi>Felicia</hi> ſpake thus. Thinke it not a ſmall occaſion that hath made him leaue you thus, for it ſhould ill beſeeme him indeede (as he well conſidered no leſſe) if he did not helpe him, that ran after his horſe, bicauſe he is a great friend to <hi>Diſteus,</hi> called
<hi>Martandrus,</hi> who as you muſt knowe went out long ſince in company of <hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius,</hi> to ſeeke out <hi>Diſteus</hi> and <hi>Dardanea:</hi> wherefore you ſhould be the rather glad of his comming at this time, bicauſe better then <hi>Placindus</hi> he can tell you out the reſt of theſe loues that <hi>Placindus</hi> hath begun. If it be ſo, ſaid Lorde <hi>Felix,</hi> and the Shepherdes, it ſhall not be likewiſe amiſſe for vs all to helpe him. And ſo riſing vp, they helped
<hi>Martandrus</hi> to get his horſe againe. But <hi>Martandrus,</hi> who

                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:23115:179"/>thou doſt bring me, I am not ſo: for I know not whether I may recken them in the number of good, or conſort them amongſt the ill. On the one ſide, by giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to thy words, I ſee my brother free from harme (which I pray the Gods may be true) and on the other, ſee not wherein thou meaneſt to place mine honour with thy pretences, which the Gods alſo permit may not be hurtfull. It likes me well to ſee my brother in health and ſafe from wounds; but it would greeue me more to haue mine honour (only in thought) called in queſtion. I am glad to know that my brother hath beene defended in ſo great danger, but ſorrie that it was by <hi>Disteus.</hi> Thou mighteſt haue pleaſed me well <hi>Palna,</hi> and no leſſe contented thy ſelfe, if with theſe good newes, thou hadſt onely told me that
<hi>Sagastes</hi> was free from danger, and not proceeded further to tell me, by whoſe means he eſcaped it. There was no cauſe I thinke (for that which toucheth me ſo neere, will not giue me leaue to vnderſtand it otherwiſe) why <hi>Disteus</hi> helpe ſhould be hidden from others, and onely made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to me. And bicauſe I finde the thought thereof ſo highly to offend mine honor: I will therefore not onely ſpeake of it, but, as though I had heard it in a dreame, quite forget it, commaunding thee (if now thou meaneſt not to go to thy <hi>Disteus</hi> againe) neuer hereafter to open thy mouth in any thing touching this matter, or that hath but a taſte thereof, vpon paine of my highe diſpleaſure, and abridging of that good will, which I haue hitherto borne thee. And that <hi>Placindus</hi> beſides offer not to put foote in my houſe, or elſe not to enter in that where <hi>Disteus</hi> dwels. When ſhee had ſaide thus, without tarrying any longer to heare the fained excuſe that <hi>Palna</hi> had alreadie prepared, in a great anger ſhee went vp to her chamber, where muſing more deepely vpon the matter, the noble vertues of <hi>Diſteus,</hi> and his bounteous minde was preſented to her tender thoughts, ſince for her mans ſake and in defence of his mortal enimy, he expoſed himſelfe to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt danger; and his approoued manhood and braue courage, whereby he got the victorie of his enimies, occurring ioyntly to her minde, and therewithall the golden praiſes which
<hi>Palna</hi> had ſo many times inſinuated in her eares, all which ſhe knewe his generall fame did confirme, made her ſo content in minde, as that to a newe borne paſſion accompanied with ſweete ioy (but of what ſhe knewe not yet) ſhe gaue a friendly welcome. Who being in theſe milde conſiderations, <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> came in with <hi>Placindus</hi> (for aſſoone as he had ſpoken to his Aunt, he went to kiſſe
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> hands) to comfort her, if perhaps ſhe had knowne any thing of that which was paſt: And as he found her all alone, and very penſiue, he thought that the late danger of his life had driuen her into that ſadde and melancholike moode, whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not to tell her all in order what had paſſed, thinking ſhe had not knowne it. To all which ſhe gaue an attentiue eare, for ſhe tooke great pleaſure to heare him tell it. But when hee tolde any thing of <hi>Placindus</hi> (whom as I ſaide ſhe knew to be <hi>Diſteus</hi>) her colour went and came; but eſpecially when he tolde that with valiant ſpeed (when they had both drawne foorth their rapiers) he ſtept in betweene them, deſiring him to keepe out, and to accept that ſmall token of dutie and good will for the ſeruice he owed to his Miſtres <hi>Dardanea.</hi> The often changing of her colour in her face gaue him no occaſion of ſuſpect, who thought it rather proceeded of feare, and of thinking in what great danger he had like to beene. After a fewe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches paſt, he tooke her aſide, and charged her to gratifie
<hi>Placindus,</hi> telling her that he would take nothing of him, and ſo hee went his waies. <hi>Palna</hi> was not preſent at any of theſe things, bicauſe ſhe would not be an eie ſore to her Miſtres with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, vntill her anger was ſomewhat paſt, who did not for all this looſe her hope; <pb n="353" facs="tcp:23115:179"/>but meaning to handle the matter wiſely, warned <hi>Placindus</hi> not to goe openly into <hi>Diſteus</hi> houſe, excuſing the matter to him, and that it was to no other ende, but that none might ſuſpect, that it was he that helped <hi>Sagaſtes:</hi> And bicauſe <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> and <hi>Dardanea</hi> (if they did knowe that he reſorted thither) woulde not beare him ſuch good will as they were woont. <hi>Palna</hi> by no meanes would make <hi>Diſteus</hi> priuie of
<hi>Dardaneas</hi> anſwer and command, bicauſe ſhe woulde not giue him ſo bad newes, knowing that without great greefe of minde hee coulde not ſuffer them. It is not needfull (Gentlemen) to tell you heere what
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> did, vntill he knew who thoſe were that aſſailed him: Let it ſuffice that they were reconciled to <hi>Sagaſtes,</hi> who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned them bicauſe they might do the like to <hi>Placindus.</hi> And
<hi>Beldaniſus</hi> coulde not chooſe but paciſie himſelfe, ſeeing that <hi>Marthea</hi> had caſt him off, and was married to
<hi>Sagaſtes.</hi> At whoſe marriage, which with ſumptuous and ſolemne feaſt and all kind of courtly ſports (too long to tell) was celebrated in the Citie, <hi>Diſteus</hi> in diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſort was euer preſent: And in Tylt and Tourney (which for the greater honour thereof <hi>Sagastes</hi> had ordeined) got ſo much glory and reputation, that as his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall deedes and gracious demeanours were the common ſpeeches of al the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ſo did the praiſes of his valour and proweſſe importune ſo much
<hi>Dardaneas</hi> cares, that ſhe was forced to loue him a little more, eſpecially when by ſome ſecret meanes ſhe vnderſtoode that ſhe was the onely cauſe why all thoſe tryumphs were done in honor of her loue &amp; ſeruice. The which alſo in particular by <hi>Disteus</hi> counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and ſhewes ſhe not vainely geſſed, although with great regard of modeſtie and reuerence he ſo behaued himſelfe, that whatſoeuer he did to make his feruent paſſion knowne, to his diſcredit, nor to her diſhonour did any waies redound. And now was ſhe ſorrie and wiſhed that ſhe had not ſo ſharpely chidden <hi>Palna,</hi> bicauſe ſhe might haue ſomtimes ſpoken to her of <hi>Disteus,</hi> and durſt not go foorth to meete her in the way, bicauſe ſhe woulde not acquaint her with the ſecrets of her hart. And needleſſe it was to ſpeake to her of it, who by ſecret and hidden ſignes concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued more then by words <hi>Dardanea</hi> durſt vtter. For <hi>Palna</hi> like a wiſe and ſuttle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man made as though ſhe did not vnderſtand that, whereof ſhe yet doubted, leaſt thereby ſhe might haue fallen into ſome newe errour, being not fully aſſured of
<hi>Dardaneas</hi> minde. And this ſhe did to make her more gentle, and to diſcouer her minde more apparantly, thereby to conduct her affaires to a better end. <hi>Disteus</hi> in the meane time made all poſſible haſte with <hi>Palna</hi> to bring him againe to the ſight of his Miſtres, or at leaſt to manifeſt his paine vnto her, or elſe to giue her a letter from him. All which <hi>Palna</hi> conſidering to be ſomewhat hard, did chooſe the leaſt, aduiſing him therefore to write, and promiſing him to finde out ſome way or other to conueigh his letter into <hi>Dardaneas</hi> handes, without any ſuſpicion or danger at all. For the better effecting whereof ſhe deuiſed (bicauſe <hi>Dardanea</hi> might not thinke that they had any conference togither, or written to one another, and alſo bicauſe ſhe might repoſe more truſt and haue the better opinion in her) that he ſhould alſo write to her, as if that letter had beene the firſt, wherein hee ſhoulde charge her to giue <hi>Dardanea</hi> the other letter that he wrote vnto her, and to leaue the care of all the reſt to her good endeuours, promiſing him to bring the matter to a good ende; but vpon ſu h a condition, that he woulde haue a little patience, if perhaps the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere were deferred for ſome fewe daies. <hi>Diſteus,</hi> as <hi>Palna</hi> did counſell him, did write, whoſe letters being receiued &amp; come as fit to her minde as could be, ſhe durſt not (for the reaſon aboueſaid) deliuer either of them to her Miſtreſſe, as alſo bicauſe ſhe would worke her purpoſe more ſure: which was, that knowing when <hi>Dardanea</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:23115:180"/>had moſt need of her, or at ſuch a time when ſhe leaſt thought of ſuch a matter, to withdraw her into an inner chamber next to her Miſtreſſes to read the letters, or to make as though he read them, bicauſe <hi>Dardanea</hi> at one time or other (ſeeing her oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied) might take occaſion to follow her, or ſet ſome to ſpie what ſhe did, thereby to come to the ſight of them: Which fell out ſo fit to her minde, as ſhe could wiſh, for as often as ſhe perceiued her to go out of her ſight, ſhe ſent her waiting maide ſecretly after her, to ſee what ſhe did: wherein ſhe was not to ſeeke, who tolde her Miſtreſſe that ſhe was writing, and bicauſe ſhe perceiued her comming, did let cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine papers fall downe by her. The deſire that <hi>Dardanea</hi> had to know what ſhe did write in ſo great ſecrecie, was not ſmall, and <hi>Palnas</hi> no leſſe to haue her ſee it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Dardanea</hi> went vp and downe muſing in her minde by what meanes ſhe might ſee it. <hi>Palna</hi> (for this was her onely deſire) knowing her minde, did hide
<hi>Diſteus</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and with them another, wherein ſhe anſwered him, with deniall of his demand to giue his letters to her Miſtreſſe, and graue aduiſe to forſake that fonde minde and purpoſe; and did put them in ſuch a ſecret place, where ſhe thought they might not be eaſilie founde, to make her Miſtreſle thinke that by no meanes ſhe woulde haue them come to any bodies hands. The more ſhe made a ſhewe to the contrary, the more did <hi>Dardaneas</hi> deſire increaſe, although ſhe kept it ſecret to her ſelfe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to come to the end of her deſſeignes, one night after they had ſupped, ſhe fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned herſelfe to be drowſie, &amp; that ſlumbring would not let her emploie that time in any other thing; &amp; thereupon withdrew herſelfe to take a nappe, commanding that none ſhould come in, nor make any noiſe at al, and to make ready her pallet, that lay beſide her bed, and to ſhut vp the windowes cloſe. All which being done ſhe went in, and when ſhe thought <hi>Palna</hi> and her waiting maides were gone backe againe to their worke, ſhe roſe vp, and opening
<hi>Palnas</hi> chamber dore very ſoftly, ſought for the letters not ſo cloſely laid vp, but that ſhe found them out. Opening the firſt that came to her hands (which was that which <hi>Diſteus</hi> had ſent to
<hi>Palna</hi>) ſhe ſawe that it ſaid thus.</p>

But howe more dangerous it is for me to haue placed thy ſelfe with faire <hi>Dardanea,</hi> my hart onely knoweth. For ſeeking reaſons to condemne thee for that, which in all mens eies made thee culpable, I found out good cauſe to giue iudgement againſt my ſelfe in that, for which, I knowe not, if I deſerue to be puniſhed.

I will ſpeake no more heereof, bicauſe all is to mine owne coſt: but by the amorous milke that I haue taken from thee, moſt humblie praie thee, and for that great portion of amity and good will which thou doſt owe me, to giue this letter to my Miſtreſſe <hi>Dardanea,</hi> (happie were I if ſhe would accept it.)

               <p>O how wiſely haſt thou done <hi>Martandrus</hi> (ſaid Lord
<hi>Felix</hi>) by warning vs to be attentiue, for this letter doth well beſeeme the perſon of a diſcreete and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured Gentleman, with what modeſtie and feare did he write it. And how true is that (ſaid
<hi>Danteus</hi>) which is almoſt in the end of it, That all things in this worlde in a different kind may be paide, as graſſe with ſheepe, ſheepe with cloth, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally all with money; but onely loue, the which, bicauſe with no other thing it hath neither equalitie nor proportion, cannot but with loue be recompenced againe. For touching my ſelfe I know, that though my Shepherdeſſe <hi>Duarda</hi> would giue me all that ſhe hath in the world; yet ſhe could not pay me that ſhe owes me, if ſhe denied me her loue. <hi>Feliſmena</hi> preuenting <hi>Duarda</hi> that was about to anſwere him, ſaid. Let vs leaue this for this time: And as you loue your ſelfe (Sir) tell on, bicauſe we may know what this Ladie did with ſuch a letter; for I know not what ſhe was able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere againe, but to yeelde her ſelfe to his loue, whereupon I thinke ſhe durſt not take in hand to anſwere ſo wiſe reaſons. Not ſo Ladie (ſaid <hi>Martandrus</hi>) for I aſſure you that <hi>Dardanea</hi> is not ſuch an one, that the high ſence and ſtile thereof could put her to a non-plus; in proofe whereof you ſhall ſee it by her anſwere. But bicauſe we may not diſcontinue ſo ſweete a diſcourſe I will proceede.</p>
               <p>This letter was of ſo great effect in <hi>Dardaneas</hi> tender hart, that now in euerie point ſhe perceiued her ſelfe yeelded to
<hi>Cupids</hi> forces: The which her criſtalline teares that iſſued out of her cleere eies, did make ſo manifeſt, that ſhe was vnable to ſtay them, although many times in vaine ſhe laboured the contrarie. But as ſhe could not ſatifie her ſelfe with reading it once or twiſe ouer, the more ſhe read it, the more her loue encreaſed: For knowing <hi>Disteus</hi> his vertues and valour to bee great, and therewithall conſidering the qualitie of his perſon, and with what milde modeſtie and diſcretion he wrote this letter, the well conceiued words thereof were ſo forcible in her minde imprinted, that they ſtrangely diſpoſed it to entertaine
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:23115:183"/>moſt louing thoughts of him that wrote them. Her kinde and tender hart was no leſſe pierced with pitie, and compaſſion when ſhe vnderſtoode in what extremities his loue conſiſted, ſince by the ſequell of his letter ſhe perceiued how abruptly he ended; whereby he manifeſted the forcible paſſion that he had in writing of his paines and ſorrowes: To all which no meane motiues in her conquered minde this moreouer occurred, that he offered to expoſe himſelfe to any danger of death for
<hi>Sagastes</hi> his mortall enemie, onely to do her ſeruice, that neuer yet had ſhewed him the leaſt fauour in the world. So that loue aſſayling her on the one ſide (which till then had not notably ſignorized in her) and her honour and vertuous reputation (which ſhe had euer religiouſly obſerued) preſſing her on the other, droue her vſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thoughts into ſuch ſuſpence, and troubled her doubtfull minde, that being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what courſe to take, or what remedie to chooſe out for the beſt, ſince ſhe would neither offend this, &amp; could not chooſe but obey that, ſhe was between two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo mightily aſſaulted, that to yeelde to one without preiudice to the other, ſhee would in a manner haue loſt her deereſt life: which ſorrowfull thoughts hiding in her ſecret breaſt, and the letters in her amorours boſome, ſhe went to her chamber, where caſting her ſelfe vpon her bed, and lying flatling vpon her pillow, thus ſhee lamented to her ſelfe.</p>
               <p>O what ſhall become of thee <hi>Dardanea,</hi> being aſſailed by two ſuch oppoſite enimies! O heauenly <hi>Diana!</hi> O inuincible <hi>Venus!</hi> How haue you both with your diuine powers ſeiſed on my yeelding ſoule? How could you, being ſo great God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, make your habitation and ſeat in ſo humble a ſublect, and in ſo baſe and little a houſe as this is? And being ſo contrarie and capitall enimies, how haue you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to your content, and my loſſe to deraigne a hard and mightie battel in ſuch a tender and weake field? Why will you execute your vnreſiſted forces in the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breaſt of a yeelded and captiue woman? Faine would I not open the gates <hi>Diana,</hi> whoſe name I honor to thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie; but pardon me, ſince I haue not my wonted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for importunate
<hi>Venus</hi> knowing how ſtrongly this tower of thinc was defended, &amp; being driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many times from it, hath now emploied all hir force in the enterpriſe, and conqueſt of it. O noble <hi>Disteus,</hi> if thy words be fained (which the Gods forbid) then is my death certaine. But why ſhould I thinke ſo when as thou are <hi>Disteus,</hi> whoſe name includes all generous virtues: and I <hi>Dardanea,</hi> whoſe minde ſuch thoughts doth ill beſeeme. Alas poore Gentleman, how vngratefully doth <hi>Palna</hi> thy nurſe requite thy fauours which ſhe confeſſeth thou haſt bountifully beſtowed on her, ſince from thy firſt deſire (a matter but of ſmall conſequence) ſhe ſo bitterly repelled thee by denying to giue me a letter, which to her hands, next to my hart thou didſt ſo earneſtly commend. What wilt thou ſay, nay what ſhall I doe, ſince ſhe that was the ſoule and onely meanes, will haue nothing to do with the matter, which ſhe hir ſelfe did firſt begin. Couldſt thou not <hi>(Disteus)</hi> or wert thow affraide to open thy greeſe vnto me, or was I vnable or too timorous to manifeſt my paſſion vnto thee? Tell me cruell <hi>Palna,</hi> what leaue hadſt thou to ſend backe againe the letter, that was onely directed to me, by not letting me once ſee it. Was it not meet thou ſhouldeſt do that, thy maſter commaunded thee, and that which was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for me? But alas thou art not in fault but I, and therefore will I onely take the puniſhment on my ſelfe, and excuſe thee from blame. For ſince I haue entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee ſo ſharply, when thou didſt ſpeake to me of <hi>Disteus,</hi> and in ſuch things, which did not any waies offend my honour, thou haſt then reaſon to vſe me cruelly in that, wherein my helpe and remedie doth chieſly conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:23115:184"/>And thus putting filence to her greefe, ſhe went muſing what meanes ſhe might vſe, to make <hi>Palna</hi> giue her the letter, whereby ſhe might haue ſome good occaſion to write vnto
<hi>Diſteus,</hi> and in the ende reſolued to take <hi>Palna</hi> on the ſudden with the letters in her hand, and to ſee them againſt her will, as ſhe could not otherwiſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine: Whereby the meanes to anſwer him againe might be fitly offered her. This determination being put in practiſe, when
<hi>Palna</hi> had the letters in her hand (for as I ſaide, ſhe read them many times of purpoſe to be ſeene) <hi>Dardanea</hi> came into her chamber, and ſhe faining as though ſhe would hide them, <hi>Dardanea</hi> importuned her to ſee them, commanding her in the ende to tell her to whom, and what ſhe wrote. But ſhe that deſired nothing more, making ſome ſimple excuſes, as though ſhe were not content therewith, at laſt ſhewed them: which, when <hi>Dardanea</hi> ſawe, faining that ſhe was angry with
<hi>Disteus,</hi> ſhe commended her that ſhe had ſo wiſely anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, though it ſufficed not (as ſhe ſaid) for ſo preſumptuous and bold a part, and that ſhe woulde therefore anſwere him with another letter to ſupplie the want of hers, to warne him, not once in thought to imagine, ſpeake, or write of it againe. In the end whereof ſhe purpoſed to tell him, by what meanes the letter came to her hands, bicauſe both of them might be blameleſſe. The which thing ſhe did put im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in practiſe, and ſo began to write: The letter being ended, ſhe read it to
<hi>Palna,</hi> and thus it ſaid.</p>

Aduiſing him beſides to note, that when ſhe warned him to ſurceaſe his loue vnto her, ſhe ſaide vnto him (if thou canſt) correcting her-ſelfe in a matter, that made ſo greatly for her owne minde; and to conſider how greatly theſe affaires did trouble her, who was continually thinking on them, and that ſhe was not perſwaded that he loued her from his hart; but aboue all things, to take heede howe much it ſtoode him in hand to keepe this ſecrecie, which ſhe committed vnto him. <hi>Palna</hi> moreouer perſwaded him to hope well, ſince <hi>Dardanea</hi> tooke delight in hearing theſe affaires, whereof ſhe made her her onely ſecretarie. Finally not to be tedious to you with ſo long a diſcourſe, a few daies after <hi>Palna</hi> vſed ſo great diligence, that ſhe got that out of <hi>Dardanea,</hi> which ſhe kept ſo ſecret in her breaſt; but could neuer winne her to ſpeake with
<hi>Disteus,</hi> vnleſſe he would firſt promiſe and ſweare to marie her, which was ſo ioyfull newes to him, who thought he wanted nothing more to make him the happieſt man aliue. So that this being done, <hi>Dardanea</hi> (though at the firſt ſhe made it ſomewhat coy) gaue him leaue to come to her houſe, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed a little while each others company in ſweete and pleaſant conuerſation, with all reſpect of reuerence and modeſtie that was requiſite in ſuch a caſe: At the ende whereof (the pleaſanter the biginning was, more bitter was the ſequell, ſince at the firſt loue ſeldome affoords one little pleaſure without diſtempering it in the end with ſorrowe and care) it fell out that <hi>Disteus</hi> hauing gone verie early to <hi>Dardanea,</hi> and <hi>Palna</hi> not remembring to ſhut the doore after him, they lay togither in one bed which was made readie for them in a faire and large Summer chamber beneath, where they had before ſometimes lyen togither: For <hi>Palna</hi> (when <hi>Disteus</hi> was come in) was warned to ſhut a certaine doore, which was a paſſage into all the houſe, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no maide nor ſeruant might come downe and goe thorow that way. But as ſhe remembred not alſo to ſhut the ſtreete doore, which they thought was ſafe enough, <hi>Sagastes</hi> by chance came in ſuſpecting leaſt of all any ſuch matter. <hi>Disteus</hi> perceiuing a greater noiſe in the chamber then a womans treading could make, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered himſelfe the beſt he could with the clothes of the bed. If
<hi>Dardanea</hi> was not altered by ſeeing her brother (iudge you Gentlemen) though then it ſtoode her in hand to diſſemble it. <hi>Sagastes</hi> ſat him downe in a chaire at the beds feete, and asked her what the matter was that ſhe went to bed ſo ſoone. Who anſwered that ſhee was not well at eaſe, and was therefore minded to take ſome Phiſicke.
<hi>Sagastes</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this, would haue beene gone, but turning his face (for now he was on that ſide of the bed where his ſiſter lay) and ſeeing a little ſtirring in the bed, asked her who was a bed with her.
<hi>Dardanea</hi> anſwered it was her Neece (for ſhe kept a little child of one of hir gentlewomen, the which (bicauſe ſhe loued it well) ſhe called her Neece:) but <hi>Sagastes</hi> thinking it was more then a childes ſtirring, did thruſt vp his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſheetes to feele the feete, <hi>Diſteus</hi> as ſoftly as he could drawing them vp. But as
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> thruſt vp his arme ſo far, that <hi>Diſteus</hi> knew he could not keep himſelf any longer hidden, with both his hands he lifted vp the clothes of the bed, and caſt them ſo happily on <hi>Sagastes,</hi> that they couered him all ouer, and therewithall lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of the bed, as though he would haue laid hands on him, <hi>Dar danea</hi> made him
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:23115:186"/>ſignes to be gone. <hi>Disteus</hi> followed her counſell, who being in his ſhirt ranne out a pace, whom <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> (after he had vnfolded himſelfe from the clothes) laying his hand on his rapier followed with might and maine not knowing him. <hi>Disteus</hi> by darke and ſecret places thought to conuay himſelfe away, but as the night was ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what cleere, he could not: So that what way ſoeuer he went
<hi>Sagastes,</hi> followed him. And if he was ſometimes out of his ſight as in ſome narrow and by lanes, the people told him which way he went.
<hi>Diſteus</hi> therefore running in this ſort, and <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> after him, he tooke a houſe, becauſe he woulde not be knowen of the people that made a great clamour to ſee a man run away in his ſhirt, and another following him with a naked rapier in his hand. Scarce had he recouered the houſe, when <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> came to the very doore. But
<hi>Diſteus</hi> kept him out by ſhutting of a doore at the ſtaires foote, &amp; ſought ſomething to defend himſelfe being naked; yea, and to hurt his enimie if he could. <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> laboured to burſt the doore in peeces to come in, &amp; cried out ſo loud to them within, to open him the doore, that if they did not, he would ſo cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, that they ſhoulde know what it was to harbour an vnknowen theefe, of whoſe fact he made them no leſſe guiltie then the principall: Wherupon the Maſter of the houſe that by this time was come to ſee what a noiſe there was, (fearing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gastes</hi> threates) came to lay hands on his gueſt &amp; to deliuer him into <hi>Sagastes</hi> hands. But perceiuing it was
<hi>Disteus,</hi> whom all the citie and countrey ſo much loued, he fell downe on his knees, beſeeching him to conuey himſelfe out of a windowe at the backſide of the houſe, bicauſe he durſt not but open his doore to
<hi>Sagaſtes;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gaue him an old cloake and a ſworde, for he had no time to giue him any more. <hi>Diſteus</hi> by this counſell which he held for good, and by neceſſitie, as the caſe requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, being forced to fulfill his friendes requeſt, yeelding him great thankes for his curteſie, went out. <hi>Sagastes</hi> was melting in his owne heate and anger, that they would not open the doore, and ſwearing he woulde kill as many as he founde in the houſe. Whereat the Maſter of the ſame, (after he had ſhewed <hi>Disteus</hi> the waie to eſcape) feyning as though he had not knowne what the matter was, came downe, and asking who knocked, opened the dore. <hi>Sagastes</hi> cauſed him ſtraight to be taken and bound, and ſearching euery corner of the houſe, but not finding him, whom hee ſought, came to him againe, ſwearing by the life of the king, that if he told him not where the man was, or who he was that came into his houſe, hee woulde preſently hange him vp at his owne doore. At which words the good man being afraide, told him (as he heard) that it was <hi>Disteus. Sagaſtes</hi> did eaſily beleeue it, for hee thought none durſt haue beene ſo bold to iniurie him in ſuch ſort but onely he: So that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had eſcaped him, without ſtaying any more, he went to <hi>Diſteus</hi> houſe with a great number of people following him. But no ſooner did <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> runne out of his ſiſters houſe to follow <hi>Diſteus,</hi> but ſhe locked her doore and told <hi>Palna</hi> what had hapned, requeſting her beſt and ſpeedie aduiſe in that matter, and to bethinke her of ſome remedie, that was beſt for them. <hi>Palna</hi> at theſe vnexpected newes was in ſuch a maze and confuſion, that ſhe could not anſwer her a word: But weighing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that <hi>Diſteus</hi> was in, and loue encouraging her (for ſhee accounted him as her ſonne) ſhe anſwered. Do you deere Miſtreſſe what you thinke good; for I meane in euery perill to follow my ſonne <hi>Diſteus,</hi> for whom I ſhall arme my ſelfe with no leſſe courage and conſtancie to ſuffer greefe and ſorrow, then I did to giue him content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pleaſure, ſo that in fewe wordes my reſolution is to know what is become of him: For if his perſon (which the Gods forbid) hath ſuffred any harme, I will not enioy mine, nor liue in this worlde without his companie. Wherefore you muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <pb n="368" facs="tcp:23115:187"/>me (good Lady) for laying all feare aſide, I will either die or know what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my beloued <hi>Diſteus.</hi> It greeues me that I am forced to leaue you in ſuch a traunce and extremitie all alone, &amp; in a time of ſo great neede, but deere Lady there lies no more in my power to perform. <hi>Dardanea</hi> with more teares &amp; ſighes, then wel ordered reaſons ſaid. Time will not giue me leaue to anſwer to that which thou haſt ſpoken, nor to make thee knowe my minde, and whether the loue which I beare to <hi>Diſteus</hi> my louing husband and almy ioy, be of leſſe weight then thine towards him, who was thy nurſe childe and all thy comfort. It woulde greeue me thou ſhouldſt haue ſuch an opinion of me, if I knewe not to manifeſt it by and by. For this thou maiſt at leaſt beleeue of me, that ſince for the greateſt I had courage enough; for the leſſer, I will haue no leſſe. Lady, ſaid <hi>Palna,</hi> heere is but little time, as you ſaide, to vſe many words, &amp; therefore determine what you meane to put in practiſe, for I will do all that you command me, vpon condition that it be not to forſake my ſonne. I will not command thee any ſuch thing (anſwered <hi>Dardanea</hi>) but that which I haue determined to do, is that as well for the great loue I owe vnto my louing Lord (for without him I will not liue) as for the feare I haue of my brother, I wil not ſtay heere. Then if it be ſo (ſaid <hi>Palna</hi>) I thinke it beſt for me to carrie
<hi>Disteus</hi> ſome garments, &amp; for you to get the beſt iewels you haue togither, and then for vs both to goe to my Nephewes houſe: for we being eſcaped and hidden, we ſhall not onely preuent this preſent danger; but time and mature conſideration ſhall diſcouer to vs what courſe is beſt to be taken. Whereupon putting this in practiſe, they went to
<hi>Placindus</hi> houſe: To whom diſcloſing the foreſaide loues (for to that time they were knowne to none but <hi>Palna</hi>) and telling what hapned the ſame night, they praied him to goe and enquire what was done.
<hi>Sagaſtes</hi> vnderſtanding it was <hi>Disteus</hi> as I tolde you, went to ſeeke him at his owne houſe, where finding the doore open, knewe he was not come, and therefore ſtaied for him there vntill he came. But when he had awai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there a good while in vaine, he ſuſpected he had taken ſome of his friends hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and therefore went home againe to his ſiſters lodging, vowing to be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of <hi>Disteus;</hi> though he would faine haue that night ſatisfied his vnruly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which was not a little augmented, when hee founde neither <hi>Dardanea</hi> nor <hi>Palna,</hi> maruelling verie much to ſee howe quiet all his ſiſters ſeruants were, and howe ſtrange they made it all, when <hi>Sagastes</hi> demaunded the matter of them. <hi>Disteus</hi> that was going home to his houſe, when hee ſawe a farre off a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people before his doore, it made him thinke (as it was true indeed) that <hi>Sagastes</hi> was waiting for him, whereupon he went to my houſe; whereby he made me knowe what great affiance he had in my friendſhip, which I accounted no ſmall credit vnto me. I doubt not Gentlemen, but any (that hath beene attentiue to my tale) will aske me, how
<hi>Sagastes</hi> came firſt to his enemies houſe, ſince <hi>Disteus</hi> went before out of the mans houſe, which he was conſtrayned to take for refuge. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it may be eaſily anſwered, that <hi>Disteus</hi> going (as you know) almoſt naked, and therefore leauing the open and common ſtreetes to goe about by lanes and ſecret places, came later then
<hi>Sagastes.</hi> But when <hi>Disteus</hi> vnlooked for came into my houſe, without calling, but ſhutting the doore after him, leaſt any had followed him, he came into my ſtudy: And his hap was ſo good that he found me al alone. I did not a little woonder to ſee him in ſuch ſort, and therefore demaunded the cauſe of his comming &amp; in ſuch a manner. Who anſwered me that he had no time for ſo large a report, but prayed me to giue him ſome apparell, and a horſe, and what elſe was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him, which I onely denied him not, but alſo preparing my ſelfe to beare him
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:23115:187"/>company, he would in no wiſe let me, for he meant to conceale (vntill he could no longer) his ſecret loue and affection from me. He therefore being apparelled, and furniſhed with the beſt offenſiue and defenſiue weapons he could chooſe out, went to helpe <hi>Dardanea,</hi> leaſt her harebraine brother in his furie might haue laide violent hands vpon her, or elſe to die in the quarrell, before ſhe ſhould ſuffer any harme at all. Going therefore about this matter, he met with <hi>Placindus,</hi> that was comming to ſeeke him out, by his Aunts commaundement, whom he asked if he knew any thing. <hi>Placindus</hi> told him, how he ſhould finde
<hi>Dardanea</hi> and <hi>Palna</hi> in his houſe, and that he ſhould goe thither quickly, bicauſe <hi>Dardanea</hi> was the moſt ſorrowfulleſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world for his danger. <hi>Disteus</hi> went thither out of hand: but knowing that place to be nothing ſo conuenient and ſecret, as their preſent neceſſitie required, bicauſe (by miſſing <hi>Palna</hi>)
<hi>Sagastes</hi> would out of hand come thither; he brought them to my houſe, willing <hi>Placindus</hi> to lye ſtill and take his reſt, bicauſe he might thereby make them beleeue, that he knew nothing of the matter. All three might come ſecretly to my houſe, bicauſe as ſiths that was not farre from <hi>Placindus</hi> lodging, ſo were they both out of the concurſe of people and walke of neighbours; and alſo bicauſe
<hi>Sagastes</hi> was gone to the King to complaine of the iniurie that
<hi>Disteus</hi> had done him, whom he requeſted to commaund a ſearch to be made in all ſuſpected houſes that were thought moſt fit to harbour him, and <hi>Dardanea</hi> and <hi>Palna.</hi> The King not only granted hereunto (for as you know he deſired to haue the leaſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whereby he might throw downe <hi>Disteus</hi> partie, to pleaſure <hi>Sagastes</hi>) but tooke this matter vpon him as his owne, and ſware to behead <hi>Disteus,</hi> and as many as were culpable, and euerie one that afterwards helpt him And therefore (to fauour him the more) made <hi>Sagastes</hi> himſelfe iudge in his owne cauſe, bicauſe he might take the greater reuenge at his own pleaſure. Who, when he ſaw ſo good a means for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, without more ado beſet <hi>Diſteus</hi> houſe with a priuy watch, hauing firſt ſearched it all thorow, where miſſing him, he went ſtraight to ſeeke out his ſiſter. They em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied all diligence and labour they thought needfull to bring their purpoſe to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but my houſe they ouerſlipt, bicauſe as it was not pliable enough to <hi>Diſteus</hi> his partie, nor I my ſelfe held for his friend, ſo was I free from all ſuſpicion that I kept him. But when they could not finde him, he commaunded a proclamation to be made, that euery one vpon paine of his head, that harboured them, or knew where they were, ſhould bring them foorth: and afterwards apprehended
<hi>Anfilardus</hi> and <hi>Placindus,</hi> and as many as they ſuſpected could tel of them, threatning them to cruel torments, yea, and putting ſome in practiſe, though all in vaine to their purpoſe. It could not chooſe but kill <hi>Diſteus</hi> his hart to ſee the ruine of his houſe, and the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of his friends and familie, who did neuertheleſſe comfort himſelfe not a little, bicauſe it was for his Lady and Miſtreſſe ſake, whom he had nowe in happie poſſeſſion, the which thing he forgot not by many ſweete and louing words to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt vnto her: who could not for all this be comforted, (though ſhe made him not priuie to her inward greefe) when ſhe thought of the vniuſt and ill name (a thing that greeued her more then death) that was ſpred abroad of that, which ſhe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more then life, and when ſhe entred into conſideration and feare of the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger wherein her beloued husband was, by meanes of the great ſearching and awaites that <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> had laide in all places to finde them out: Wherefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him aſide, ſhe ſaide thus vnto him. I know well my Lord, that my Fortune would not leaue me without ſome ſorrowfull occurrent in ſo ſweete an eſtate, nor to doe leſſe with me then euer turne moſt bitterly againſt the pretence of my
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:23115:188"/>content. It greeues me to ſee thee take and taſte ſome part of my ſorrow, wherein yet I do comfort my ſelfe againe, that I ſhall not be the laſt in offring vp my life for the leaſt danger for thy ſake, ſince I was the firſt in ſacrificing my ſoule to thy will, obteſting almightie God that as I had no force with my feeble iudgment to gainſay thy deſire, I had alſo ſufficient valour with my life to deliuer thee from theſe moſt wrongfull turmoyles. I ſee thee heere in great extremities (for mine owne I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but ſmall) and therefore my opinion concurring with my deſire is, that ſince for many daies we are neither ſafe heere, nor in any other part of the kingdome are like to be no leſſe, thou wouldſt reſolue to conuey vs into any place, where wee might in more ſafety ouer paſſe this cruell ſtorme of Fortune, aſſuring thee my deere Lord, that if I ſawe thee free from danger, I would not take care for the reſt. I might well paſſe ouer this new bond, my ſweeteſt Lady anſwered <hi>Diſteus,</hi> with many more already paſt, wherein after that I was thine, thou haſt ſo much obliged me, ſince I was neuer able yet to diſcharge them, the which (vnleſſe the vnſpeakable loue which I haue borne thee, and wherein I meane to die doth not with fauour come in part of their account and ſatisfaction) muſt ſtill remaine (the more my greefe) in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer force, when as the diſproportion of my ſmall abilitie can neuer counteruaile their encreaſing value. I haue remembred and weighed that with my ſelfe, which thou didſt command me, but would not hitherto tell thee ſo much, fearing to giue thee any occaſion of ſorrow by abſenting thy ſelfe from thy friends and kinsfolkes, and from thy houſe, and quiet reſt, to carie thee to ſome vncouth place amongſt ſtrangers to liue in pouertie and vnreſt. If you regard this my Lord, ſaide <hi>Dardanea,</hi> you do alſo forſake this and much more. But admit I leaue all this, and you nothing at all, in not leauing you, I might well thinke I left nothing at all. No more of this ſaid
<hi>Diſteus,</hi> but were it not fonfeare of thy trouble and harme, I woulde deſire no other heauen in this world then to haue thee continually in my preſence: But let vs make my mother priuie of it, who will counſell vs as ſhe hath done, what is beſt for vs, and direct vs in all our matters. They therefore calling <hi>Palna</hi> vnto them, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her their mindes, ſhe ſaide. And knowe yee my good ſonne and daughter, that
<hi>Martandrus</hi> and I were alſo talking of the ſame matter, who is no leſſe troubled in minde, fearing there will be a ſearch made in his houſe, whereby great harme may befall vs, and no good to him at all. I would not tell you of it, bicauſe you might not thinke he did it for any feare that concerned him. When ſhe had ſaid thus, ſhe called me before them, and
<hi>Diſteus</hi> began to ſay thus vnto me. If I knewe thee not to be a faithfull friend <hi>Martandrus,</hi> I would not haue put the weight of ſo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires in thy truſt and ſecrecie, nor omit with words (ſince I cannot with deedes) to gratifie that which thou haſt done for me. But as I haue experimented, and doe yet trie the contrarie, I hope, thou wilt not blame me, if I make not ſome outwarde and apparant ſhewe of thankes for it: But for the preſent remedie of our dangerous eſtate, wee are determined to flie the furie of our king with the abſence of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for which eſcape we craue not onely thy aduiſe, but aſſiſtance, and how it may be done without our diſcouerie. Concerning that ſuppoſed debt (ſaide I) which you my good Lord confeſſe you owe me, I will not anſwer you, but only touching that, which you haue committed to my charge, ſince it hath pleaſed you to make mine the greater, by hauing amongſt all others, choſen me out for your onely friende, which I eſteeme more then all that I did euer for you in my whole life, all which were it ten times more, is nothing in reſpect of this fauourable truſt which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in me. As for the reſt let euery one of vs thinke what we haue to do, and how to <pb n="371" facs="tcp:23115:188"/>take the beſt courſe. Al fower of vs therfore laying our heads togither in counſel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great while euery one hauing told his opinion, as mine was thought the beſt, ſo was it allowed &amp; choſen, which was, That ſince
<hi>Sagastes</hi> had placed watchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the citie gates, &amp; eſpecially by night, that none might paſſe, vnles he were knowne what he was, the beſt way to get out was, that I ſhould cauſe three cartes to come that euening from my farme (for they knew I had a Farme but three miles out of the city) to bring certaine prouiſion from thence for my houſe, &amp; other things, though I had no need of them: So that the cartes might come thither at Sunſet, &amp; go emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie backe againe the ſame night when it began to waxe darke, bicauſe ſeeing them to go home againe without any thing, they might not ſuſpect our drift, and yet (though they had looked narrowly into the Carts) might as little haue ſuſpected any ſuch matter; for vnder them I had deuiſed to binde certaine great ſackes at length, with their mouthes open, in each a peece euerie one to put themſelues, and to ſend the Carters after they had vnladen (bicauſe they might not be priuie to it) to ſome place or other, while in the meane time I diſpatched our ſecret affaires, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made meanes before in my Farme that it might not be knowen of any: All which was done in ſuch ſort, that there was not as much as any ſuſpition of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ſame night that I carried them to my Farme, we all went to counſell what way we might beſt deuiſe for three of them to go out of the kingdome to ſome ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie place, where they might not be purſued, and liue vnknowen. And our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was, that <hi>Disteus</hi> ſhould take one of thoſe Carts, and make himſelfe a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
<hi>Dardanea</hi> and <hi>Palna</hi> in poore apparell goe out of the kingdome, and in the beſt manner they could, in habits cleane different from their eſtates paſſe into <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacrta,</hi> and that from that place, where they made their aboade, write to me of their ſucceſſe. Still did
<hi>Sagastes</hi> ſet watch and ward in euerie place (for it was his chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt deſire to catch <hi>Disteus</hi>) that none of them might eſcape, whoſe eruell purpoſe yet (and not without reaſon) the furie of his anger did chaunge. For as he knew that all men loued <hi>Disteus,</hi> and that all his friends (if without iuſt cauſe he apprehended and puniſhed him) would diſcouer themſelues and bandie againſt him, and by theſe meanes (perhaps) draw himſelfe into great danger: So was he not a little content to ſee the head of the contrarie ſide taken away, and his capital enimie abſent, whereby he thought to do well enough with the reſt. But yet he knew not that his ſiſter was likewiſe gone with him, but thought ſhe was in ſome of her kinsfolkes houſes. So that <hi>Disteus</hi> being abſent, <hi>Sagastes</hi> might confiſcate his goods and condemne him for a traitour, ſince he appeered not at the Kings call, by whoſe commaund
<hi>Sagastes</hi> ſeiſed indeed vpon all <hi>Disteus</hi> lands and his Siſters goods, which were not a fewe. Heere is no time to tell you, Gentlemen, of the teares, that were ſpent betweene me and my noble gueſts at their departure: But that <hi>Disteus</hi> prayed me by my ſelfe or by my friends to helpe <hi>Anfilardus</hi> and <hi>Placindus</hi> the beſt I could, and to get them out of priſon, for this was the onely thing (he ſaid) that did trouble him. So that they being gone from me, and I from them in body,
<hi>Disteus</hi> went, as I told you, to <hi>Tynacria,</hi> where (as afterwards I vnderſtoode) buying a little flocke of ſheepe to diſſemble his noble condition with this baſe eſtate, they were ſome daies there, perhaps with more harts eaſe then in <hi>Eolia,</hi> bicauſe they enioyed there, without any feare and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, their ſweete contents, and were well beloued and reuerenced of all the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds thereabouts, who endeuoured to do them all the pleaſure they could; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with rurall ſports and games; other times with dances and paſtorall muſicke. To all which
<hi>Disteus</hi> ſo well applyed himſelfe, that in a ſhort time he farre excelled <pb n="372" facs="tcp:23115:189"/>them all. And ſo for this reſpect, as for his affabilitie and mildnes, by knowing how to conuerſe with all, that Shepherd thought himſelfe vnhappie, that had not ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate friendſhip with <hi>Coryneus</hi> (for ſo he named himſelfe after he had changed his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit:) and <hi>Dardanea</hi> that named her ſelfe <hi>Dinia,</hi> was no leſſe acceptable to all the Shepherdeſſes, and <hi>Palna</hi> called
<hi>Corynea,</hi> like her ſonne, was reuerenced of them all. When all three went from me, <hi>Dardanea</hi> was gone two moneths with childe: but what God ſent her, or what became of the childe ſhe brought foorth, I know not, for they had not dwelta whole yeere in that countrey, when they went away for what cauſe, or whither, I alſo know not. The cauſe whereof (conſidering the time wherein they went away) I ſuſpect was this. That in this meane while King <hi>Rotyndus</hi> married with the Kings ſiſter of that Prouince where they were; whoſe wifes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little while after being dead, an vncle of hers (called <hi>Synistius</hi>) aſpired to the kingdome, as Competitor with her. For the which cauſe <hi>Rotyndus</hi> making warre againſt him, with little loſſe of his men got the victorie, whereupon a peace was concluded betweene them; and the gouernment of the kingdome, by the interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
<hi>Agenesta</hi> his niece (for ſo was the Queene called) giuen frankly to
<hi>Synistius.</hi> So that <hi>Disteus</hi> as ſoone as the noyſe of this warre was bruted abroad, went as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture (bicauſe he would not be knowen) from that countrey with his pettie family. From which time I could neuer heare more of them, though manie daies haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince
<hi>Anſilardus</hi> and <hi>Placindus</hi> went out to ſeeke them: And omitting mine own trauels (Gentlemen) and manie troubles that I paſſed in the like enterpriſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make not any whit to the purpoſe of your demaund, I will onely tell you, how theeſe two ſeruants of theirs went out ſo ſoone, being (as I told you before) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and I ſo late, being, as you haue alſo heard, at libertie. When King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyndus</hi> married his Queene, in ioy of the feaſt, all the priſoners were let goe, amongſt whom <hi>Anfilardus</hi> and <hi>Placindus</hi> came out, and ſixe moneths after (to make <hi>Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes</hi> ſuſpect it the leſſe) by venturing their liues (for vpon paine of death it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that none ſhould goe ſeeke out <hi>Disteus</hi>) they went to the place, where I told them they were. At which place when they could not find them, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, by ſeuering themſelues to ſeeke them out, appointing to meete at that place a yeere after, to know how they had ſped; and bicauſe the one might not goe that way, or take in hand that the other did. Whereof as of all things elſe, though they for the ſpace of ſixe yeeres from time to time informed me; yet I know not how nor by what ſiniſter meanes it came to paſſe, that in more then twelue yeeres after, the end of the foreſaid time expired, I neuer heard any newes of them, nor of their maſter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at being greatly greeued in minde I endeuoured to ſeeke out ſome good meanes (or rather fained occaſion) to go about the ſame errant, whereunto by the Kings moſt ſtreight edict I could neuer directly accommodate my ſelf, in regard of which iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, if hope might haue perſwaded me to finde them out, I would not haue neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both that, and all paines abroad and affaires at home whatſoeuer. But being in this impatient deſire, two braue yoong youths (moſt highly fauoured of <hi>Agene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor</hi> Prince of <hi>Eolia,</hi> with whom they were both brought vp) were alſo determined to ſeeke out their parents, knowing that thoſe were not the ſame, for whom they had till then taken them. Theſe yoong Gentlemen <hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> (for ſo they were called) leauing aſide how much for their rare giftes and virtues they deſerued the loue of all, of purpoſe I endeuoured to make my ſpecial friends to this effect, that as they were in great fauour with the King and Queene, by their meanes and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Prince, I might finde ſuch fauour with them all, that if <hi>Disteus</hi> and his
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:23115:189"/>companie were perhaps found out they might get their pardon, and be reſtored againe to their former eſtates and reputation, which we thought might eaſily be obtained, ſince King <hi>Rotyndus,</hi> by the good examples of his virtuous Queene <hi>Agenesta</hi> (whom God preſerue for many yeeres) &amp; by her holy life &amp; conuerſation, had almoſt now forſaken his old co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions. Wherby (gentlemen) we may note, how the good examples of a vertuous wife, doe oftentimes worke to amend and correct the lewde diſpoſition of a vitious husband: And therefore it is ſaide, that the wiſe is the mirrour of the husband, and the woman to the man, bicauſe the man looking into her, as into a cleere glaſſe, may frame his life and minde to her modeſtie and ſemblance: And contrarie, the man is the womans glaſſe for the ſelfeſame cauſe and reaſon. Wherefore
<hi>Rotindus</hi> loued not now <hi>Sagaſtes</hi> ſo well, as in times paſt, and liked leſſe his lewde conditions, which ſauoured nothing of vertue, whereon if any humane thought or action be not grounded, it is not durable any long time: for as vice is nothing, being the priuation of vertue, ſo is that of no ſtabilitie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manence which is grounded vpon it. The fame of <hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the end thereof was in a few daies ſpred ouer all the citie, whereat though moſt were ſorie, yet ſome, who enuied their deſerued fauour (for noble vertue is euer accompanied with baſe enuie) were not wanting that ioyed to ſee that day. This fit occaſion therefore for the effecting of that which you ſhall heare offering it ſelfe to my ſemblable deſſeignes, comming vnto them, I vſed theſe wordes. As I cannot be ſorie, Gentlemen, and my deere friends, for your departure, ſince it is a thing that concernes you ſo much: So am I not a little glad, that it hath ſo happily fallen out for my determinations, if in this iourney my poore companie (for onely yours heerein I deſired) ſhall not be any waies troubleſome vnto you: And bicauſe you may knowe the forcible cauſe that mooues me heereunto, I will (vpon that fidelitie and truſt, which with all men, but eſpecially with me you haue alwaies vſed) moſt frankly tell it you. As it is not vnknowen to you (I thinke) what great friendſhip hath been betweene <hi>Diſteus</hi> and me, and (for my part) ſhall euer be while my ſoule ſhall rule this earthly body: So muſt you know againe, that I concealed and kept him cloſe, vntill I found out the meanes to put him in ſome ſafetie of his life; and (not content with this) would (if he had giuen me leaue, or if it had not beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to his ſecret departure) haue accompanied him to the extremeſt danger of mine owne: ſince which time I haue had a great deſire to ſeeke him out, the which for two cauſes I haue left of: The one, bicauſe two of his ſeruants, who had no little care of that buſines, haue many daies ſince gone from hence to ſeeke him out. The other depending of this, bicauſe it behooued me to remaine here ſtill to procure his pardon, and leaue (if he had beene found) to come to his owne againe. When
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filardus</hi> and <hi>Placindus</hi> went hence, there was an agreement betweene vs, that they ſhould aduiſe me of all they knew; the which thing being not performed certaine daies after, I coniecture that they are either dead, or not at libertie. With this hope (or to terme it better deſpaire) I haue (though meanly) to this point fed my thoughts: The which being of late ſo mightily increaſed; and Fortune preſenting to my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ſo good an occaſion for my ſecret departure; and occaſion taking away all ſuſpicion that I goe to ſeeke <hi>Diſteus,</hi> but onely to accompanie you, tels me, that there remaines nothing elſe, but your fauourable acceptance of my companie into yours, onely to paſſe out of the citie, and afterwardes if it pleaſe you, to diuide our ſelues, or doe as likes you beſt. To this (like diſcreete and aduiſed youthes, being faithfull to me their friend, and loyall to <hi>Rotindus</hi> their king) they anſwered thus. As <hi>Disteua</hi> 
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:23115:190"/>and <hi>Dardaneas</hi> misfortunes (although we know them not) <hi>(Martandrus)</hi> haue not a little (as yet they doe) moſt iuſtly greeued vs, for their rare vertues and goodnes, that thorow out this kingdome we haue alwaies heard of them; ſo if our ſeruice might in any thing auaile either you or them, we would moſt willingly ſhew the arguments of our good will, which couets nothing elſe but fit meanes, to make ſome triall thereof; yet not denying that ſmall ſeruice wherein our ſlender abilities doe conſiſt, prouided, we doe not any thing in priuate or publike againſt that, wherein we are bound to our ſoueraine Lord the king, without whoſe countenance and woonted fauour we are no bodie. But we haue thought of a better and more conuenient way, whereby more then your requeſt ſhall be performed, and wherein we will not faile in our duties to our king, nor to you, nor in friendſhips holy lawes. And it is, That as the yoong Prince (as it is well knowen vnto you) doth not meanely loue vs: and is not wel content (by as much as I can perceiue by him) with thoſe extremities which are done to this Gentleman; ſo by theſe, as alſo by the Queenes meanes I hope, to get leaue of the king for you not onely to depart in our companie, but to ſeeke them out, aſſuring your ſelfe, that after they are found all ſhall be well ynough: for though we come not ſo ſoone againe, yet we will leaue a ſupplication in his behalfe with the Queene and the yoong Prince; which fauour if we cannot obtaine, we will furthermore ſo handle the matter, that you, nor any elſe ſhall take no harme or blame for this. For by committing the matter into the Queene and Princes handes, we wil trauel &amp; take ſuch paines therein, as though from vs &amp; from no other, it only came. Do Gentlemen (ſaid I againe) as it pleaſe you beſt, and heorewithall beleeue me that (for their ſakes) I would not be ſorie for any harme that might redound to me, ſo that it might fall out to their good. They are much beholding to you (ſaide they) but I more bound to them, ſaide I. In the ende; after a few daies they got leaue to ſeeke whom they would, the which being bruted ouer all the citie gaue no ſmall content to
<hi>Diſteus</hi> his friendes. And thus without ſtaying any longer, I went with <hi>Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius</hi> out of <hi>Eolia,</hi> all three of vs prouiding neceſſaries for ſo vncertaine and long a iourney, wherein (after a while diuiding our ſelues) ſuch hath my fortune been, that in two yeeres ſpace ſince I went out, I neuer heard any newes of them, but onely thoſe which <hi>Placindus</hi> (when I found him heere) hath tolde me of
<hi>Delictus,</hi> and the beſt of the Ladie <hi>Felicia,</hi> that hath aſſured me, that ſhortly I ſhall ſee them all here, whereof I haue no doubt, ſince ſhe hath ſaide it. That which hath happened to me in ſo long a trauell, and the troubles that I paſſed, as well for that I account them light for ſo good a cauſe as this, and that by the fauours of the Gods, I ſhall ſoone enioy their wiſhed companie, as alſo for that which you commanded me to do, it makes ſo ſmall to the purpoſe, that I will with your good leaue omit to report. So that Sir (ſpeaking to Don
<hi>Felix</hi>) you plainely ſee, who <hi>Corineus, Dinia,</hi> and
<hi>Corinea</hi> are, and the cauſe of their exile, and of our long iourney. And pardon me if I haue beene too long, ſince your demaund required no leſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pariſiles</hi> and all the reſt yeelding him great thankes for that he had told them, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that the fault was rather greater, by making ſo ſhort an end to ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a hiſtorie, and that he did not prolong it with recitall of his trauels and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which befell to him in ſeeking out <hi>Diſteus.</hi> Let it not trouble you now (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) for not onely this, but the ſucceſſe of
<hi>Disteus</hi> life and his miſhaps and theirs that did participate his company and fortunes in this iourney, with thoſe occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents that befell to
<hi>Plactndus</hi> in his trauels, and that which hapned to others that went out to ſeeke <hi>Parthenius</hi> and <hi>Delicius,</hi> ſhall haue their fit time, wherein you ſhall <pb n="375" facs="tcp:23115:190"/>take no ſmall delight to heare them. With this hope (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vs, although it will be later, then we deſire. Whereupon returning now to the Temple, and eight daies being paſt, <hi>Felicia</hi> ſaid to
<hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia.</hi> It is nowe time my ſonne &amp; daughter, that the friendſhip, which to this hower you haue borne
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> be ſhowen: and becauſe you may know, &amp; that it may be made manifeſt vnto you, what great need he hath both of his friends and of you, you muſt vnderſtand, that when you ſhall come to your fieldes, you ſhall finde many Shepherds doing their laſt duties to <hi>Delius</hi> as this day dead, who (as I told you) was many daies ſince very ſicke. And as of purpoſe I ſent <hi>Syrenus</hi> before now, by vertue of a new drinke, which at his departure I gaue him, to rekindle that quenched flame of
<hi>Dianas</hi> loue in his breſt (a thing no leſſe conuenient to his weale then conſonant to my will) ſo would I not, that in the meane time, while he was with vs, the two foreſaide Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds (being not a little enamoured of her, and not woorthie to be caſt off) ſhould be preferred before him, both which haue beene, and are yet not a little entred into her good liking. Now therefore is the time, wherein he needeth moſt of all your help, and no leſſe requiſite for you to go finde him out; aſſuring you, that it will not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle greeue you to ſee <hi>Syrenus</hi> matched with ſuch dangerous corriuals as theſe two Shepherds are. <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> (though <hi>Delius</hi> death did a little greeue them) forgot not moſt humbly to thanke <hi>Felicia,</hi> not onely for her good will, and friendlie aduiſe, but alſo for the approoued affection and deſire ſhe had to helpe their beloued friend <hi>Syrenus;</hi> And thereupon ſaid vnto her. We cannot but obey your command (good Lady) although we would be faine heere, when <hi>Coryneus</hi> and his companie comes. Well well (anſwered <hi>Felicia</hi>) this Shepherd is not ſo nigh, nor cannot come back ſo ſoon, nor you ſo far off, but that you may be certified when they are to come. Since it is then ſo (ſaid Lord <hi>Felix</hi>) with your leaue (good Lady) I will take <hi>Feliſmena</hi> with me, and accompanie theſe Shepherds, in whoſe amorous ſtrife and riualitie which you but euen nowe ſpake of, I ſhall take no ſmall pleaſure and delight. The ſame affirmed <hi>Martandrus, Placindus, Danteus,</hi> and <hi>Duarda</hi> with one voice. If it pleaſe you ſo (ſaid <hi>Felicia</hi>) on Gods name let it be: but it behooues you (Gentlemen) and thee faire <hi>Feliſmena</hi> no leſſe, leaſt the baſhfull Shepherds eſtrange themſelues from your companie, to borrowe for a while their paſtorall habite, and condition: the which being no ſooner agreed vpon, but put in practiſe, they went to
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him to carie all in remembrance that paſſed betweene the corriuals, the better to report it afterwards, when they ſhould meete all togither.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer therefore is deſirous to ſee the funerall of
<hi>Delius,</hi> the riualitie of <hi>Syrenus, Firmius,</hi> and
<hi>Faustus,</hi> and be at all their meetings, and takes any pleaſure to know who <hi>Stela</hi> is, and woulde faine knowe what her troubles, and thoſe of <hi>Crimine, Delicius</hi> and <hi>Parthenius,</hi> haue beene, and to what ende they came, as alſo the loue of <hi>Agenestor,</hi> prince of
<hi>Eolia</hi> and of <hi>Luſtea</hi> daughter to <hi>Diſteus</hi> and
<hi>Dardanea,</hi> let him attende me in the third part of this worke, which ſhall come to light out of hande.</p>

<hi>Syrenus,</hi> was now an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his forgetfulnes, &amp; of that great contempt that he did beare her.

               <p>Enamoured <hi>Diana</hi> had not ſo ſoone made an end of her delightfull muſicke, if on the ſudden ſhe had not beene interrupted by a certaine Shepherdeſſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a tuft of Haſels was hearkening vnto her: Who therefore eſpying her, gaue a pauſe to her ſweete voice by cutting off the ſubſtance of her ſong, and was not a little greeued (which by a naturall bluſh that tainted her faire face, might eaſily be coniectured) that her ſong was heard, and her griefe vnknowen; eſpecially percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the ſame Shepherdeſſe to be a ſtranger and neuer ſeene in thoſe parts before. But ſhe, who from a far off had heard ſo ſweete a ſound, with ſilent ſteps drew neere to enioy ſuch daintie melodie; and vnderſtanding the cauſe of her dolorous ſong, made on the ſudden ſo goodly a ſhewe of her excellent beautie before her, as the Nocturnall Moone is woont to doe, when with her ſhining beames it pearſeth and ouercomes the foggie thicknes of the darke clouds. But ſeeing <hi>Diana</hi> to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what troubled in minde at her ſight, with a merrie countenance, ſhe thus began to ſay vnto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:23115:193"/>I haue not a little (faire Shepherdeſſe) with my interrupting preſence (which to ſmall purpoſe hath thus diſturbed thee) offended the great content, which I had to heare thee; but the deſire I haue to know thee, and to giue thee ſome lightning for thy griefe, that cauſeth thee ſo pitifully to moane, may ſerue (if it pleaſe thee) for my excuſe, and make me blameleſſe heerein. For the which griefe, though it is boote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as ſome ſay, to ſeeke any comfort; yet by a free will and reaſons deuoide of paſſion there may be ſufficient remedies applyed. Diſſemble not therefore with me thy ſorrowes, and thinke it not much to tell me thy name, and the cauſe of thy ſad complaints, ſince for this I will make no leſſe account of thy perfections, nor iudge thy deſerts to be of leſſe value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diana</hi> hearing theſe words, ſtoode a while without anſwering her againe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her eies faſtened on the rare beautie of that Shepherdeſſe, and her minde oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in a doubtfull conſtruction of that, which ſhe ſhould anſwere to her gentle offers and louing words, and in the end anſwered her thus againe.</p>
               <p>If the great pleaſure, which I take in beholding thee (vnknowen Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, and curteous without compare) and the comfort, which thy ſweete words do promiſe me, might finde any ſmall kinde of confidence or hope in my afflicted hart, I would then beleeue that thou wert able to remedie my ſorrowes, and would not doubt to manifeſt my paines vnto thee. But my griefe is of ſuch tenour, that when it begins to moleſt me, it ſeiſeth in ſuch ſort on my heart, that it ſtops vp all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages againſt remedie: Yet know (Gentle Shepherdeſſe) that I am called <hi>Diana,</hi> knowen too well in all the fields and villages hereabouts; and ſo let it content thee to knowe my name, and not to enquire further of ſorrowes, ſince thou ſhalt profit thee no more, then to make thy ſelfe compaſſionate and condolent for my tender yeeres, ſeeing them oppreſſed with ſo many cares and troubles.</p>
               <p>Thus are they deluded (anſwered the Shepherdeſſe) that make themſelues ſlaues to fonde Loue, who but beginning to ſerue him, are become ſo much his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, that they deſire not to be free, and thinke it impoſſible to be manumitted from his ſeruitude. If loue be thy greefe (as by thy ſong I am ſure it is) then know (faire Shepherdeſſe) that in this infirmitie I haue no ſmall experience: For I my ſelfe haue beene manie yeeres a captiue in like bondage, but now am free; blinde I was, but now haue found out the way of truth: I haue paſſed in the amorous Ocean manie dangerous ſtormes and tempeſts, and now am ſafely arriued in the ſecure hauen of content and reſt: And though thy paine be neuer ſo great; yet hath not mine, I dare boldly ſay, beene leſſe: And ſince for the ſame I found out a happie remedie, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh not hope from thy minde, ſhut not vp thine eies from the truth, nor thine eares from the ſubſtance of my words.</p>
               <p>Are they words (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) that ſhall be ſpent to remedie my loue, whoſe workes exceed the compaſſe and helpe of wordes. But yet for all this faine would I know thy name, and the cauſe that hath brought thee into our fields; the which if thou wilt vouchſafe to tell me, ſhall ſo greatly comfort me, that I will for a while ſuſpend the complaints that I haue begun, a thing perhaps which may not a little auaile for the lightning of my griefe.</p>
               <p>My name (ſaid the Shepherdeſſe) is <hi>Alcida:</hi> but the reſt which thou demandeſt of me, the compaſſion which I haue of thy voluntarie greefe, will not ſuffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, before thou haſt embraced my wholſome remedies, though (perhaps) vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerie to thy diſtempered taſte.</p>
               <p>Euery comfort, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> ſhall be moſt gratefull to me that commeth from <pb n="381" facs="tcp:23115:193"/>thy hands, which neuertheleſſe is not able to roote out the ſtrong loue in my breſt, nor to remooue it from thence, without carying my hart with it burſt in a thouſand peeces: And though it might, yet I woulde not liue without, bicauſe I woulde not leaue to loue him, who being once forgotten of me tooke ſo ſudden and extreme a reuenge of my vniuſt crueltie.</p>
               <p>Nay then (ſaid <hi>Alcida</hi>) thou giueſt me no little hope and confidence of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie, ſince now thou loueſt him, whom thou haſt heeretofore hated, hauing lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby the pathway to obliuion, and acquainted thy will with contempt, and the more, ſince betweene theſe two extremes loue and hate there is a meane, which thou muſt embrace and follow.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Diana</hi> replied and ſaid. Thy counſell (faire Shepherdeſſe) contents me very well, but I thinke it not ſure enough for my ſafetie, nor the beſt in common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for my auaile. For if my will were put betweene loue and hate, I ſhoulde ſooner yeelde to loue then to hate; bicauſe being neerer to it, mightie <hi>Cupid</hi> with greater force woulde aſſaile, and ouercome me.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Alcida</hi> anſwered. Do not honor him ſo much, who deſerues it ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, calling him mightie, who may be ſo eaſily ouercommed, eſpecially by thoſe that chooſe out the meane aboue ſaid: for therein doth vertue conſiſt, and where that is, all harts are armed with force and conſtancie againſt loue.</p>
               <p>Thou mighteſt better terme thoſe harts cruell, harde, vntamed, and rebellious, ſaid <hi>Diana,</hi> which pretend to repugne their proper nature, and to reſiſt the inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble force of loue. And yet when they haue oppugned it as much as they liſt, in the end they haue little cauſe to bragge of their ſtoutnes, and leſſe helpe to defende them with their fooliſh hardines. For the power of loue ouercomes the ſtrongeſt holdes, and makes moſt way thorow, where it is moſt reſiſted: of whoſe maruels and memorable deedes my beloued <hi>Syrenus</hi> did on a day ſing in this verie place, at that time when his remembrance was ſo ſweete, as now moſt bitter to my ſoule. The which Sonnet, and all his other Ditties, which he then made and ſung, I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hauing euer a great care not to forget them for certaine cauſes, which perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to regiſter the words and deeds of my deereſt <hi>Syrenus</hi> in perpetuall memory: But this which intreats of the mightie force of Loue, ſaith thus.</p>

               <p>No doubt, ſaid <hi>Alcida,</hi> but the forces of loue are well extolled: But I would rather haue beleeued <hi>Syrenus,</hi> if after hauing publiſhed the furie of <hi>Cupids</hi> arrowes <pb n="382" facs="tcp:23115:194"/>to be ſo great, and after hauing commended the hardnes of his chaines, he had not alſo found out the meanes to ſet himſelfe at libertie: And ſo I maruell that thou wilt ſo lightly giue credit to him, who makes not his word and deed all one. For it is very cleere, that the Songs and Sonnets are a kinde of a vaine and ſuperfluous praiſes, whereby louers ſell their ils for dangerous things, when that ſo eaſily of captiues they become free, and fall from a burning deſire to a ſecure obliuion. And if louers feele paſſions, it proceedeth of their owne will, and not of loue, which is not but a thing imagined of men; a thing neither in heauen, nor earth, but in his hart, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines it: whoſe power (if any he haue) onely by the default of thoſe he vſurpes, who of their owne accord ſuffer themſelues to be ouercommed, offering him their harts for tribute, and putting their libertie into his hands.

Theſe are they, who gaue to Loue that name which makes him ſo famous thorow out all the world. For ſeeing how fonde men for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing well did ſuffer ſo many ſurſaults, feares, cares, iealouſies, changes, and other infinite paſſions, they agreed to ſeeke out ſome principall and vniuerſall cauſe, from whence, as from a fountaine all theſe effects ſhould ariſe. And ſo they inuented the name of Loue, calling him a God, bicauſe he was of many nations and people fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and reuerenced, and painted him in ſuch ſort, that whoſoeuer ſawe his figure, had great reaſon to abhorre his faſhions.

Thou muſt not vnderſtande (faire Shepherdeſſe) that the power which men attribute to Loue is, or may be any waies his: But thou muſt rather beleeue, that the more they magnifie his might and valour, the more they manifeſt their weaknes and ſimplicitie. For in ſaying, that Loue is ſtrong, is to <pb n="383" facs="tcp:23115:194"/>affirme, that their will is weake, by ſuffering it ſo eaſily to be ouercommed by him: To ſaie, that Loue with mightie violence doth ſhoote mortall and venemous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, is to include that their harts are too ſecure &amp; careleſſe, when that ſo willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they offer themſelues to receiue them. To ſay, that Loue doth ſtreightly capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate their ſoules, is to inferre, that there is want of iudgement and courage in them, when at the firſt bruntes they yeelde; nay when ſometimes without any combate they ſurrender their libertie into their enimies hands: and finally all the enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they tell of Loue, are nothing elſe but matter of their miſeries, and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their weakenes. All which force and proweſſe admit to be his, yet are they not of ſuch qualitie, that they deſerue any praiſe or honour at all. For what courage is it to take them priſoners, that are not able to defend themſelues? What hardines to aſſaile weake and impotent creatures? What valour to wounde thoſe that take no heede and thinke leaſt on him? What fortitude to kill thoſe that haue alreadie yeelded themſelues? What honour with cares to diſturbe thoſe, that are mery and ioyfull? What woorthie deede to perſecute vnfortunate men? Truely faire Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe, they that would ſo much extoll and glorifie this <hi>Cupid,</hi> and that ſo greatly to their coſt ſerue him, ſhould (for his honour) giue him better praiſes. For the beſt name that amongſt them all he gets, is to be but a cowarde in his quarrels, vaine in his pretences, liberal of troubles, and couetous in rewards. Al which names, though of baſe infamie they ſauour, yet are thoſe woorſe which his affectionate ſeruants giue him, calling him fire, furie, and death, terming (Louing) no better then to burne, to deſtroy, to conſume, and to make themſelues fooles, and naming themſelues blinde, miſerable, captiues, madde, inflamed, and conſumed. From hence it comes, that generally all complaine of Loue, calling him a Tyrant, a Traytour, vnflexible, fierce and vnpitifull. All Louers verſes are full of dolour, compounded with ſighes, blotted with teares, and ſung with agonies. There ſhalt thou ſee ſuſpicions, there feares, there miſtruſtes, there iealouſies, there cares, and there all kindes of paines. There is no other ſpeech amongſt them but of deathes, chaines, darts, poyſons, flames, and other things which ſerue not but to giue torments to thoſe, that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie their fancies in it, and feare when they call vpon it. <hi>Herbanius</hi> the Shepherde famous in <hi>Andolozia,</hi> was troubled too much with theſe termes when in the barke of a Poplar, with a ſharp bodkin, inſteed of his pen, in preſence of me wrote theſe verſes following.</p>

For if his operations be to kill, to wound, to make blind, to burne, to conſume, to captiuate, and to torment, he ſhall neuer make me beleeue, that to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine things of paine doth lighten the griefe, which muſt rather (as I thinke) giue greater force and feeling to the paſſion: For when it is more in imagination, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth longer in his heart, and with greater paine torments it. And if that be true which <hi>Syrenus</hi> did ſing, I much maruell that he receiuing ſo deepe a taſte in this thought, hath now ſo eaſily changed it, by meanes of ſo cruell obliuion, not onely of loues operations, but alſo of thy beautie, which ought not for any thing in the world to be forgotten.</p>

If ſhe be ſo firmely rooted in thy hart, which I may well preſume, how can that loue thou oweſt her be ſo ſmall as only to content thy ſelfe with her liuely figure engrauen therein, and not feede thine eies with the continuall ſight of her ſingular beautie.</p>

               <p>Do not to ſo ſmall purpoſe (ſaid <hi>Alcida</hi>) preiudicate thy comely graces, <hi>Diana,</hi> nor offer ſuch iniurie to the generall voice the world hath of thy perfections, ſince it is no leſſe beſeeming a faire woman to haue ſome ſmall conceit and opinion of herſelfe, then a point of raſh iudgement to terme her proud and arrogant, that doth moderately acknowledge the ſame.

<hi>(Delius)</hi> for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man in the world, and with pride inioy this fauour that Fortune hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thee, who neuer gaue, nor can giue any thing, that in felicitie may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable with the husband of

<hi>Delius</hi> both marked and gazed on, made ſo deepe an impreſſion in his hart, that at the ende of her gentle and diſcreet words, he was ſo greatly enamoured of her, that, like a ſenceleſſe and aſtoniſhed man, he had not one word to anſwere her againe, onely giuing, with a new burning ſigh, a manifeſt token of the greene wound, that <hi>Cupid</hi> had made in his conquered hart.</p>
               <p>But now about this time they heard a voice, the ſweetnes whereof delighted them maruellouſly. They gaue therefore attentiue eare vnto it, and caſting their eies from whence it reſounded, they ſaw a Shepherd comming with a wearie pace towards the fountaine, and going like one that was ſurcharged with griefe and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of minde, ſinging as followeth.</p>

               <p>The Shepherd had ſcarce ended his ſong, when <hi>Alcida</hi> knowing who he was, trembled like an Aſpen leafe in euerie part of her bodie; wherefore ſhe roſe vp in great haſte to be gone before he came to them, requeſting <hi>Delius</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> not to tell him that ſhe had beene there, ſince it was as much as her life was worth, if that Shepherd whom ſhe hated more then death, did either finde or had any knowledge of her. They promiſed her ſo to do, though verie ſorie for her ſudden and haſtie departure. <hi>Alcida</hi> as faſt as ſhe could hye her, recouered a thicke wood not far from the fountaine, and fled with ſuch celeritie and feare, as if ſhe had beene purſued by ſome hungrie and cruell Tygre.</p>
               <p>Immediately after the Shepherd wearied with extreme trauell and trouble, came to that place, which Fortune (it ſeemed) condolent for his griefe, had offered him, and that cleere fountaine, and <hi>Dianas</hi> companie for ſome lightning of his paine: who being faint after his painfull iourney, and ſeeing the Sunne in the pride of his heat; the place verie pleaſant; the trees caſting forth coole ſhades; the graſſe freſh and greene; the fountaine cleere &amp; criſtalline, and <hi>Diana</hi> paſſing faire; thought good to reſt himſelfe a while, though the earneſt care and haſte of that he went ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and the ceaſeleſſe deſire he had to finde it, gaue his wearied bodie no place of reſt, nor eaſe to his afflicted minde: The which <hi>Diana</hi> perceiuing, ſhewed her ſelfe as courteous towards him, as <hi>Delius</hi> iealous eie (who was preſent) would giue her leaue; and yet entertained the ſtrange Shepherd with ſweete words, as well for his owne deſerts, which ſhe deemed not ſmall; as alſo for that ſhe perceiued him tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the like grief that ſhe was. The Shepherd cheered vp by <hi>Dianas</hi> friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome and ſeemely fauours, of a miſerable man, thought himſelfe happie by finding out ſo good a chaunce. But they being thus togither, <hi>Diana</hi> by chaunce ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her eie aſide, could not ſee her husband
<hi>Delius,</hi> who newly ſurpriſed in <hi>Alcidas</hi> loue, when
<hi>Diana</hi> tooke leaſt heed of him, and while ſhe was entertaining the newe Shepherd, purſued amaine the Shepherdeſſe that fled away, and tooke the verie ſame way with a ſtrong reſolution to follow her euen to the other part of the world. <hi>Diana</hi> not a little perplexed to ſee her husband wanting ſo on the ſudden, called and cried a good while togither on the name of <hi>Delius,</hi> but all in vaine to get an anſwere from him in the wood, or to make him leaue of his fonde purſuite, who rather run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after her as faſt as he could, thought at the laſt to ſeaſe vpon his beloued <hi>Alcida.</hi> Whereupon when <hi>Diana</hi> perceiued that
<hi>Delius</hi> appeared in no place, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe a moſt ſorrowfull woman for him, and lamented in ſuch pitifull ſort that the Shepherd to comfort her, ſaid thus vnto her.</p>
               <p>Afflict not thy ſelfe thus without reaſon (faire Shepherdeſſe) and beleeue not <pb n="389" facs="tcp:23115:197"/>thine owne imaginations ſo greatly preiudicially to thy reſt and quiet: for the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd whom thoumiſſeſt, is not ſo long ſince wanting, that thou maieſt haue anie cauſe to thinke that he hath forſaken thee. Pacifie then thy ſelfe a little, for it may be that when thy backe was turned, he hauing ſome deſire to change place, ſecretly got away, vnwilling (perhaps) that we ſhoulde ſee him go for ſeare of ſtaying him, being inuited by the coole ſhades of thoſe greene Sicamours, and by the freſh and pleaſant winde that is gently blowing them; or elſe perhaps diſcontended for my comming hither, thinking my companie troubleſome, whereas now without it he may merrily paſſe the heate of the day away.</p>
               <p>To this anſwered <hi>Diana.</hi> By theſe words (gracious Shepherd) which thy toong hath vttered, and forced cheere which thou diſſembleſt, who cannot conceiue the greefe that conſumes thy life? Thou ſheweſt well that loue is thy torment, and art accuſtomed to deceiue amorous ſuſpicions by vaine imaginations. For it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tricke of louers, to work their thoughts to beleeue falſe and impoſſible things, bicauſe they would not credite things that are certaine and true. Such comforts (gentle Shepherd) auaile more to quote out the ſorrow of my greefe by thee, then to remedie my paine. For I know well enough, that my husband
<hi>Delius</hi> is fledde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a moſt faire Shepherdeſſe, who went but euen now from hence, and in regarde of the great and feruent loue wherewith he beheld her, and ſighes, which for her ſake came ſmoking from his hart, I do verily beleeue (knowing moreouer how ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly he performes that he imagines or takes in hand) that he will not leaue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that Shepherdeſſe, though he thinke to come neuer in my ſight againe. And that which greeues me moſt is, that I know her diſpoſition to be ſo rigorous, and her hart ſo great an enimie to Loue, that ſhe will not onely ſhew him no pitic, but with great deſpite contemneth the moſt ſoueraigne beautie, and greateſt deſerts that may be.</p>
               <p>At theſe very wordes the ſorrowfull Shepherd thought that a mortall dart pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his chill hart, and therefore ſaide. Vnhappie me moſt wretched Louer, what greater reaſon haue not theſe harts (not made of ſtonie flint) to be ſorrowfull for me, when thorow out the worlde I ſeeke the moſt cruell and pitileſſe Damſell that liues on earth? Ah faire Shepherdeſſe, thou haſt good cauſe to be ſorrie for thy huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for if ſhe whom he followes, be ſo cruelly conditioned as this, then muſt his life be in great danger.</p>
               <p>By theſe words <hi>Diana</hi> cleerely perceiued, what his greefe was, and that the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe that ranne away at his comming, was the very ſame, whom in ſo many parts of the worlde he had ſought. And ſo ſhe was indeede; for when ſhe began to flie from him, ſhe tooke the habite of a Shepherdeſſe, by that meanes not to be knowne nor diſcourered. But for that preſent time <hi>Diana</hi> diſſembled with the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and woulde tell him nothing of the matter, to keepe her worde and promiſe which ſhe had giuen <hi>Alcida</hi> at her departure: And alſo bicauſe it was now a good while ſince ſhe was gone, and ranne with ſuch haſte thorow the thicke wood, that it was impoſſible for him to ouertake her. All which if ſhe ſhould tell the Shepherd, ſhe thought would ſerue for nothing elſe but to adde a freſh wounde to an old ſore, and to trouble his minde more, by giuing him ſome little hope to attaine to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when by no meanes he was able to obtaine it. But bicauſe ſhe deſired to know what he was, the ſumme of his loue, and the cauſe of her hate, ſhe ſaid vnto him.</p>
               <p>Comfort thy ſelfe (Shepherd) in theſe thy complaints, and of curteſie tell me their cauſe: for to lighten them, I would be glad to know who thou art, and to heare <pb n="390" facs="tcp:23115:198"/>the ſucceſſe of thy miſhap, the report whereof will be no doubt delightfull to thee, if thou beeſt ſo true a louer as I do take thee.</p>
               <p>He then without much entreatie, both of them ſitting downe by the cleere foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine began thus to ſay. My greife is not of ſuch quality, that it may be told to al kind of people, though the good opinion I haue of thy deſerts and wiſedome, and the confidence which thy vertues and peereleſſe beautie do ſuggeſt to mee, vrge me to lay open before thee the totall ſumme of my life (if ſo it may be called) which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly long ſince I would haue changed for death.</p>
               <p>Know therefore faire Shepherdeſſe, that my name is
<hi>Marcelius,</hi> and my eſtate far different from that, which my habite doth teſtifie: for I was borne in <hi>Soldina,</hi> the chiefeſt citie in
<hi>Vandalia,</hi> of parents for birth and bloud renowned, and in all wealth and power abounding. In my tender yeeres I was caried to the king of
<hi>Portugalles</hi> court, and trained vp there, where, not onely of all the chiefeſt Lords and Knights I was beloued, but eſpecially of the king himſelfe; inſomuch that I had neuer his good will and leaue to depart from thence, vntill at the laſt he committed to my gouernment a charge of certaine men of warre, which he had in the coaſt of <hi>Africa.</hi> There was I a long time captaine of the townes, and fortreſſes that the king had on the ſea ſide, remaining with my chiefeſt garriſon in <hi>Ceuta,</hi> where the originall of all my hard haps was firſt commenced. For in that towne (to my great harme) dwelled a noble and renowned Knight called <hi>Eugerius,</hi> who had alſo a charge by the King, and gouernment of the ſame towne, whom God (beſides that he had adorned and inriched him with the gifts of nature, and Fortune) had bleſſed with a Sonne called <hi>Polydorus,</hi> valiant without compare, and with two daughters, called <hi>Alcida</hi> and
<hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi> women of moſt rare and excellent beautie.
<hi>Clenarda</hi> was verie skilfull in dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of her bow and in ſhooting; but <hi>Alcida</hi> which was the eldeſt, endowed with incomparable beautie: whoſe vertues ſo inflamed my hart with burning loue, that they haue cauſed me to leade this deſperate kinde of life, which I now paſſe away, wiſhing for death, which euerie day I call vpon and attend. Her father was ſo tender and charie ouer her, that few times he ſuffered her to be out of his ſight, which thing was no ſmall impediment to the opening of my griefe and great loue I bare her, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſometimes when it was my fortune to ſee her by an appaſſionate eie, and many ſighes (maugre my will) came forciblie out of my breſt, I ſignified my paines vnto her. At one time among the reſt, I wanted not opportunitie to write a letter vnto her, which fit occaſion by fauourable fortune granted me, I omitted not but wrote to her this letter following.</p>

               <p>This was the letter I wrote vnto her; the penning whereof, had it beene as fine, as the purpoſe fortunate, I would not haue changed my skil in poſie for famous <hi>Homers.</hi> It came to <hi>Alcidas</hi> hands, in whoſe hart (when finally ſhe knew the ſumme of my griefe, though at the firſt the contents of my letter with my too great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption did ſomewhat offend her) it made deeper impreſſions then I imagined, or hoped for. Then I began to manifeſt my ſelfe for her open Louer, by making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie braue Iuſtes, and encounters at Tilt and Tourney, running of wilde Buls, and
<hi>juego de Cannas,</hi> by celebrating for her ſweete ſake and ſeruice Moreſco ſportes on horſebacke in the day time, and maskes and ſtately dances in the night, cauſing conſorts of ſundrie muſicke to delight her, and making verſes, impreſas, and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammes of her loue and name, and many other gallant ſhewes and inuentions more for the ſpace of two whole yeeres togither. At the ende whereof, <hi>Eugerius</hi> thought me woorthie to be his ſonne in law, and by the requeſt of ſome great Lords in thoſe parts, offered me his faire daughter <hi>Alcida</hi> for wife. We concluded that the eſpouſall rites ſhould bee ſolemnized in the citie of
<hi>Lysbone,</hi> bicauſe the king of <hi>Portugall</hi> might with his preſence honour them: and therefore diſpatching a Poſte with all haſte, by him we certified the king of this marriage, and requeſted his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie to giue vs leaue (hauing commended our charges and affaires to perſons of truſt) to celebrate it there. Whereupon the report of this ſolemne day was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed thorow all the citie, and places farre and neere, which cauſed ſo generall a ioy, as was due to ſo faire a dame as <hi>Alcida,</hi> and to ſo faithfull a louer as my ſelfe. Vnto this paſſage my good fortune conducted me, thus high ſhe reared me vp to throw me downe afterwardes headlong into the depth of miſeries, wherein (wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched man) I ſtill remaine.

What greater ioy could I haue wiſhed for, then that I had alreadie receiued, and what greater croſſe am I able to ſuffer then this; which I now carie about me? Oh faire Shepherdeſſe, entreat me no more to moleſt thy eares with ſo large and lamentable a hiſtorie, nor to pierce thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate hart with recitall of my enſuing calamities.

And that which greeues me moſt, is that my diſgraces are ſuch, that they muſt <pb n="393" facs="tcp:23115:199"/>needs fill thy hart full of ſorrow, when thou knoweſt them; for the paine that I muſt paſſe by telling them, I reckon not ſo great, but that I would willingly ſuffer it in lieu of thy contentment. But bicauſe I ſee thee ſo deſirous to heare them out, although they ſhall force me to make thee ſorrowfull; yet I will not ſeeme to leaue thy will herein vnſatisfied.</p>
               <p>THen Shepherdeſſe, thou muſt knowe, that after my vnfortunate marriage was agreed vpon, the Kings licence being now come, her old father <hi>Eugerius,</hi> who was a widower, his ſonne <hi>Polydorus,</hi> and his two daughters <hi>Alcida</hi> and <hi>Clenarda,</hi> and the hapleſſe <hi>Marcelius,</hi> who is telling thee his greeuous accidents, hauing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the charges left vs by the King to ſufficient and truſtie Gentlemen, embarked our ſelues in the port of <hi>Ceuta</hi> to goe by ſea to the noble citie of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> there to celebrate (as I ſaide) the marriage rites in preſence of the King. The great content, ioy, and pleaſure which we all had, made vs ſo blinde, that in the moſt dangerous time of the yeere, we feared not the tempeſtuous waues which did then naturally ſwel &amp; rage, nor the furious &amp; boyſterous winds, which in thoſe moneths with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force &amp; violence are commonly woont to blow: but committing our fraile barke to fickle Fortune, we launched into the deepe and dangerous ſeas, heedleſſe of their continuall chaunges, and of innumerable misfortunes incident vnto them. For we had not ſailed far, when angrie Fortune chaſtiſed vs for our bold attempt, bicauſe before night came on, the warie Pilot diſcouered apparant ſignes of an imminent and ſudden tempeſt. For the thicke and darke cloudes began to couer the heauens all ouer, the waues to roare and murmur, and contrarie windes to blow on euerie ſide. O what ſorrowfull and menacing ſignes, ſaid the troubled and timorous Pilot? O luckleſſe ſhip, what perils aſſaile thee, if God of his great goodnes and pitie do not ſuccour thee? He had no ſooner ſpoken theſe words, when there came a furious and violent blaſt of winde, that puffed and ſhooke the whole bodie of the ſhip, and put it in ſo great danger, that the routher was not able to gouerne it, but that toſſed vp and down by this mightie furie, it went where the force of the angrie waues and windes did driue it. The tempeſt by little and little with greater noiſe began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and the rauing billowes couered ouer with a fomy forth mightily to ſwell: The skies powred downe abundance of raine with throwing out of euerie part of it fearful lightnings, &amp; threatned the world with horrible thunders. Then might there be heard a hideous noiſe of Sea monſters, lamentable outcries of paſſengers, and flapping of the ſailes with great terrour. The winds on euerie ſide did beat againſt the ſhip, and the ſurges with terrible blowes ſhaking her vnſteadie ſides, riued and burſt aſunder the ſtrong and ſoundeſt plaunchers: Sometimes the proud billowe lifted vp vs to the skies, and by and by threw vs downe againe into deepe gulphes, the which alſo with great horrour opening themſelues, diſcouered to our fearfull eies the deepe and naked ſandes. The men and women ran on euerie ſide to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long their enſuing and haples death; and did caſt out, ſome of them dolefull ſighs; other ſome pitifull vowes; and others plentie of ſorrowfull teares. The Pilot being appalled with ſo cruell Fortune, and his skill confounded by the countenance and terrour of the tempeſt, could now no more gouerne the tottered routher. He was alſo ignorant of the nature and beginning of the windes, and in a moment deuiſed a thouſand different things. The marriners likewiſe agaſt with the agonie of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching death, were not able to execute the Maſters commaund, nor (for ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, noiſe and outcries) could heare the charge &amp; direction of their hoarſe <pb n="394" facs="tcp:23115:200"/>and painfull Pilot. Some ſtrike ſaile, others turne the maine yarde; ſome make faſt againe the broken ſhrouds; others mende and calke the riuen planks; ſome ply the pompe apace, and ſome the routher; and in the end, all put their helping hands to preſerue the miſerable ſhip from ineuitable loſſe. But their painfull diligence did not helpe them, nor their vowes and teares profit them to pacifie proud <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Neptunes</hi> wrath: but rather, the more the night came on, the more the winds blew, and the ſtorme waxed greater and more violent. And now darke night being fully come, and angrie Fortune continuing ſtill her ſeuere puniſhment, the olde Father <hi>Eugerius</hi> being paſt all hope of helpe and remedie, looking on his children and ſon in lawe, with an appalled and altered countenance, felt ſuch great ſorrowe for the death that we had to paſſe, that his greefe and compaſſion for vs, was more bitter to our ſoules, then the thought of our proper and preſent misfortunes. For the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting olde man, enuironed on euery ſide with care and ſorrowe, with a pitifull voice and ſorrowfull teares, ſaid thus. Ah mutable fortune, common enimie to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane content, howe haſt thou reſerued ſo great miſhap and miſerie for my ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full olde age? O thriſe bleſſed are they, who fighting in the middes of bloudie bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails, with honour die in their yoong and luſtie yeeres, bicauſe not drawing foorth their line to wearied old age, haue neuer cauſe with greefe to bewaile the vntimely death of their beloued children. O extreme ſorrow! O balefull ſucceſſe! who euer ended his daies in ſo heauie a plight as I poore diſtreſſed man, that hoping to haue comforted my naturall death, by leauing them to the worlde, that might haue ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not onely to performe the due of my laſt obſequies, but to continue my line and memorie, muſt now (miſerable man) periſh in their deereſt companie. O my deere children, who would haue thought that my life and yours ſhould ende at one time and by one misfortune! Faine woulde I (poore ſoules) comfort you; but what can a ſorrowful father tell you, in whoſe hart there is ſuch aboundance of greefe and want of conſolation? But comfort your ſelues my children, by arming your inuincible ſoules with patience, and lay all the burden of your ſorrow vpon my backe, for beſides that I ſhall once die for my ſelfe, I muſt ſuffer ſo maine deaths more, as you haue liues to leeſe.</p>
               <p>This did the olde and ſorrowfull man abruptly deliuer with ſo many teares and ſobbes, that he could ſcarce ſpeake, embracing firſt one and another, and then alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither for his laſt farewell, before the very point of danger and death was fullie come. But now to tell thee of
<hi>Alcidas</hi> teares, and to recount the greefe that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for her ſake, were too difficult and long a narration. Onely one thing I will not omit to tell thee, that that which did moſt torment me, was to thinke, that the ſame life which I had offered vp for her ſeruice, ſhould now be iointly loſt with hers.</p>
               <p>In the meane while, the forlorne and toſſed ſhip, by the force and violence of the fierce weſterne windes, which by the ſtreights of
<hi>Gibraltar,</hi> came blowing as they were madde, ſailed with greater ſpeede then was expedient for our ſafetie, and being battered on euery ſide with the cruell blowes of enuious fortune by the ſpace of a daie and a night (vnable alſo to be guided by the skill and ceaſeleſſe labour of the marriners) ran many leagues in the long <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſea, whereſoeuer the force of the waues &amp; windes did carrie her. The next day following Fortune ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a little while to waxe more calme &amp; gentle, but on a ſudden turning againe to her acccuſtomed crueltie, ſhe droue vs into ſuch danger, that nowe we looked not for one halfe hower of life. For in the ende a fierce and mightie tempeſt came ſo ſuddenly vpon vs, that the ſhip driuen on by the force of a boiſterous blaſt, that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:23115:200"/>ſmit her on the ſtarboord, was in ſo great danger of turning bottome vp, that ſhe had now her forepart hidden vnder the water: whereupon I vndid my Rapier from my ſide (eſpying the manifeſt and imminent danger) bicauſe it might not hinder me, and imbracing my
<hi>Alcida,</hi> leaped with her into the Sciffe that was faſtened to the ſhip. <hi>Clenarda,</hi> that was a light and nimble damſell, followed vs, not forgetting to leaue her bowe and quiuer in the ſhip, which ſhe eſteemed more then any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. <hi>Polydorus</hi> imbracing his old father <hi>Eugerius,</hi> had alſo leapt in with him amongſt vs, if the Pilot of the ſhip with another mariner had not beene before him: But at that very inſtant when <hi>Polydorus</hi> with olde <hi>Eugcrius</hi> were next to them, preparing themſelues to leape out of the ſhip, a mighty great blaſt of winde ſmiting on the larboord, brake the cockboate from the ſhip, and droue them ſo far aſunder, that thoſe miſerable men that were in her, were conſtrained to tarrie there ſtill, from which time (vnleſſe a little while after) we loſt ſight of them, and knew not what became of the ſhip, but doe verily thinke, that it was either ſwallowed vp by thoſe cruell waues, or elſe ſmiting vpon ſome rocke or ſandes neere to the coaſt of Spaine, is miſerably caſt away. But <hi>Alcida, Clenarda,</hi> and I remaining in the little Sciffe that was guided by the induſtrie of the Pilot, and of the other mariner, went floting vp and downe a day and a night attending euery minute of an hower apparant death, without hope of remedie, and ignorant in what coaſt we were. But the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning finding our ſelues neere to land, we made towardes it amaine. The two mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that were very skilfull in ſwimming, went not alone to the wiſhed ſhore, but taking vs out of the boate caried vs ſafely thither. After that we were deliuered from the perils of the ſea, the mariners drew their Sciffe to lande, and viewing that coaſt where we arriued, knew that it was the Iland <hi>Formentera,</hi> woondering not a little that in ſo ſmall time we had run ſo many miles. But they that had ſo long and certaine experience of the caſuall effects, which outragious tempeſts are woont to cauſe, maruelled in the end not much at the prepoſterous courſe of our nauigation. Now were we ſafely com to land, ſecure from the dangers of paſſed fortune, but yet ſurcharged with ſuch ſorrow for the loſſe of <hi>Eugerius</hi> &amp;
<hi>Polydorus,</hi> ſo ill intreated by greef &amp; care, &amp; ſo weakened by hunger &amp; cold, that we had no leſſe ſure hope of our ſafety, nor recouery of our liues, then ioy of our paſſed perils. I paſſe ouer with ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, faire Shepherdeſſe, the great complaintes that <hi>Alcida</hi> &amp; <hi>Clenarda</hi> made for the loſſe of their father &amp; brother, bicauſe I wold quickly com to the period of this lacryma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hiſtorie, &amp; to the haples ſucceſſe that befell to me ſince I came to that ſolitary I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: For after that in the ſame I was deliuered from Fortu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es crueltie, Loue enuying that poore content of mine, became my mortall foe ſo extremely, that ſorrowing to ſee me eſcaped from the tempeſt, with a new and greater greefe (when I thought my ſelfe moſt ſafe) he tormented my ſcarce reuiued ſoule. For alas, wicked loue wounded the Pilots hart (whoſe name was <hi>Sartofano</hi>) and ſo enamoured him on
<hi>Clenardas</hi> beautie, that (to come to the end of his deſire, by imagining and hatching in his wicked hart a ſtrange and inopinate treaſon) he forgat the lawe of faith and friendſhip. And thus it was: That after that the two ſiſters had with bitter teares and lamentations offered vp the ſorrowfull effectes of their louing harts as obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies to the ghoſtes of their deceaſed parents, it fell out that <hi>Alcida,</hi> wearied with the long greefe and troubles that ſhe had paſſed, laide her ſelfe downe vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> when I perceiued, I ſaid to the Pilot.</p>
               <p>My friend <hi>Sartofano,</hi> vnleſſe we ſeeke out ſomthing to eat, or if in ſeeking, our hard <pb n="396" facs="tcp:23115:201"/>fortune will not conduct vs where we may finde ſome foode, wee may make full account that we haue not ſaued our liues, but rather changed the manner of our death. Wherefore I pray thee, my good friend, to goe with thy fellow marriner to the firſt village thou canſt finde in this Iland to ſeeke out ſome victuals for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of our hungrie bodies.</p>
               <p>Whereunto <hi>Sartofano</hi> anſwered. Though Fortune hath ſufficiently fauoured vs by bringing vs ſafe to lande, yet thinke not
<hi>(Marcelius)</hi> to finde any thing heere to eate; this being an Iland, of townes deſert, and of people inhabited: But to comfort you againe, I will tell you a remedie, how to ſaue our ſelues from dying for hunger. For, ſee you yonder little Iland right ouer againſt vs, and ſo neere to this? There is ſo great ſtore of veniſon, conies, and hares, and many other wilde beaſts, that in great heardes they go togither without feare or danger at all. There alſo dwelleth a certaine Hermite, whoſe celle is neuer without, bread, oyle and moale. I therfore thinke it beſt that
<hi>Clenarda</hi> (who is cunning in ſhooting, and hauing her bowe and arrowes heere ſo fit for the purpoſe) paſſe ouer in the boate to the Ilande to kill ſome of thoſe wilde beaſts, whom my fellowe and I will tranſport whileſt you ſtaie heere to beare <hi>Alcida</hi> companie: for it may fall out that we will returne before ſhe awake, and come hither againe with good ſtore of freſh and ſauorie prouiſion.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>Clenarda</hi> and I liked <hi>Sartofanos</hi> counſell well, leaſt of all ſuſpecting his ſuttle &amp; ſecret treacherie, yet ſhe would neuer conſent to go into the Iland without my company, for ſeare of committing herſelfe alone to the rude marriners; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe requeſting my companie, I made many excuſes to ſtaie behinde, telling her that it was not meete to leaue <hi>Alcida</hi> alone and ſleeping in ſo ſolitarie a place: Who anſwered me againe, that ſince the diſtance of the place was but ſmall, the game much, &amp; the ſea ſomwhat calme (for by that time that we were a litle while on lande, the tempeſt began to ceaſe) we might go hunt and come againe before
<hi>Alcida</hi> (who had not ſlept ſo long before) awaked. In the end ſhe ſhewed me ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, that forgetting what I had to do in ſuch a caſe, without more adoo I agreed to go with her; which thing greeued
<hi>Sartofano</hi> to the hart, who had rather had <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardas</hi> company alone for the better effecting of his wicked purpoſe. But yet the Traytour for all this wanted not ſuttletie to proſecute his diueliſh pretence. For
<hi>Alcida</hi> being left aſleepe, and both of vs got into the Sciffe, and lanched into the deepe, before we came to the Iland all vnawares and vnprouided of weapons (for I had left mine in the ſhip, when I skipt out of it to ſaue my life) I was aſſayled by both the marriners, and vnable to helpe my ſelfe, bound both hand foote. <hi>Clenarda</hi> ſeeing their treaſon, for ſudden griefe would haue lept into the ſea; but ſhe being ſtaied by the Pilot, and carried from the place where I was to the other ende of the boate, he ſaid thus in ſecret to her. Trouble not thy ſelfe (faire gentlewoman) to ſee vs ſo rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entreate this Traitour, but quiet thy minde, for what is done, is all for thy ſeruice. For know (faire Miſtreſſe) that this
<hi>Marcelius,</hi> when we arriued at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Iland, had ſome priuate talke with me, and prayed me to perſwade thee to goe a hunting into this Iland; and when we ſhould be at ſea, to ſteere the boate directly from that place, telling me, that he was greatly in loue with thee, and that he would leaue thy ſiſter in the Ilande, onely and without impediment to enioy his pleaſure of thee: And the deniall of his companie with thee to this place, which faintly he vſed, was but diſſembled to colour his wicked intent the more. But I conſidering with my ſelfe what a vile and barbarous a part it was to offer violence to ſo ſingular beautie, and to ſo good a Ladie, to preuent this inhumanitie from thy great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:23115:201"/>euen at the verie point when he would haue committed his treaſon, reſolued to be loyall vnto thee, and ſo haue bound
<hi>Marcelius</hi> as thou ſeeſt, with determination to leaue him in this caſe at the ſhoare of a little Iland which is neere at hand, and afterwards to returne with thee to the place where we left <hi>Alcida:</hi> This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that makes me do thus, and therefore conſider well what thou meaneſt to doe. When <hi>Clenarda</hi> heard this ſmooth tale, which the wicked Traitour ſo cunningly had told her, ſhe beleeued it ſo truely, that preſently ſhe bare me mortall hatred, and was well pleaſed, it ſeemed, that I was carried to the place, where <hi>Sartofano</hi> did meane to lande me. For with a frowning countenance ſhe beheld me, and for very anger could not ſpeake a word, vntill ſhe had a pretie while reioyced in her ſecret hart to thinke of the reuenge and puniſhment, that ſhould light vpon me, not telling me one word of that braue deceit, wherewith ſhe was ſo much abuſed. All which when by her ioyfull countenance I perceiued, &amp; that my bonds did not grieue her, it made me ſay thus vnto her. What meanes this ſiſter, doeſt thou eſteeme ſo lightly of both our paines, that ſo ſoone thou haſt ended thy complaints? Perhaps thou art in good hope to ſee me by and by at libertie to be reuenged of theſe villanous Traitours? Then like a fierce Lyoneſſe ſhe told me, that my impriſonment and bonds where for no other cauſe, but for the cruell intent I had to leaue <hi>Alcida,</hi> and to carrie her away, and the reſt, whereof the falſe Pilot had wickedly informed her. When I heard theſe words, I neuer felt like griefe in my life, and inſtead of laying violent hands vpon theſe Traitours, with vile and outragious words I railed vpon them; and with good proofes ſo well perſwaded her of the truth, that ſhe perceiued by and by that it was a manifeſt peece of treaſon, ſprung vp of
<hi>Sartofanos</hi> vile and filthie loue: Whereupon ſhe made ſo great lamentation, that ſhe fell foorthwith into the pitifull diſcourſe of their deceite, which was forcible enough to haue mollified the craggie rockes we paſſed by with ruthe and compaſſion, though it wrought nothing in the hard harts of thoſe two wicked monſters. Imagine then now how the little ſciffe that floted vp and downe the wide ſeas, was in a ſmall time carried a great way from the Ilande, when vnfortunate <hi>Alcida</hi> awaking, and ſeeing her ſelfe all alone, and forſaken, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her ſorrowfull eies to the maine ſea, and not finding the ſciffe, how in euerie part of the ſhoare thereabout, ſhe went ſeeking vp and downe and found no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at all. Ah thou maiſt conceiue (faire Shepherdeſſe) what anguiſh of minde ſhe felt in theſe croſſes of vniuſt Fortune! Imagine beſides, what plenty of teares ſhe powred forth, in what extremities and wants ſhe was, how ſometimes (perhaps) ſhe would haue caſt her ſelfe into the ſea, and how often in vaine ſhe called vpon my name. But alas we were gone ſo far, that we could not heare her pitifull outcries, and might onely perceiue (how by ſhaking a white ſcarffe vp and downe in the Aire) ſhe incited vs to turne backe againe, which the wicked Traitour <hi>Sartofano</hi> would neuer agree to. But making the greateſt haſte away that he could, he brought vs to the Iland of
<hi>Yuiça,</hi> where diſimbarking vs, they left me faſt bound to an anchor that was pitched in the ground. That way by chance came certaine Marriners of <hi>Sartofanos</hi> acquaintance, companions like him ſelfe, whom though <hi>Clenarda</hi> neuer ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of her eſtate, innocencie, and misfortune, yet it auailed her nothing to make them take pitie on her, but they rather gaue to the Traitour ſufficient prouiſion, who went to imbarke himſelfe againe with <hi>Clenarda,</hi> whom poore ſoule (at her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill) ſhe muſt needes follow; from which time hitherto I neuer ſaw nor heard any newes of them. There was I left all alone bound hand and foote, and pinched with intolerable hunger. But that which moſt of all greeued me, was
<hi>Alcidas</hi> want and <pb n="398" facs="tcp:23115:202"/>ſorrow, who was likewiſe left alone in the Iland <hi>Formentera,</hi> and in lieu thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not mine owne, which was preſently remedied. For at the noiſe of my loude and lamentable outcries, certaine Marriners came to me, who being more pitifull then thoſe before, gaue me ſome meate to ſtanche my extreme hunger. And at my inceſſant requeſt, they armed for my ſake a Fregantine, and carrying with them ſome ſtore of meate and wine, with weapons, and other neceſſaries embarked themſelues in my companie, and within a ſhort time, with ſwift and ſpeedie oares it came to the Iland of
<hi>Formentera,</hi> where <hi>Alcida</hi> was left a ſleepe. But for all that I could doe by ſeeking vp and downe in it, and hallowing in euerie place, and calling aloud on <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> name, I could neither finde her, nor by any ſigne perceiue that ſhe was there. I then thought that ſhe had deſperately throwen her ſelf into the ſea, or elſe that ſhe had beene deuoured of wilde beaſts. But yet ſeeking vp and downe the plaines and ſhoares, and all thoſe rockes and caues, and moſt ſecret corners of the Ilande, in a peece of a rocke, made in forme of a quarri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:23115:202"/>her, nor heare which way ſhe was gone, vntill a long time after I vnderſtoode that ſhe knew how I had notice of her, which made her flie the farther from me, and to paſſe into <hi>Spayne</hi> in a ſhippe of <hi>Genua.</hi> Then I embarqued my ſelfe preſently to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, and hither I am come into <hi>Spayne,</hi> where hauing troden the greateſt part of it in ſeeking her vp and downe, haue not yet found any one, that coulde tell mee any newes of this cruell one, whom with ſo great greefe and trouble of minde and bodie I am continually ſeeking, and can neuer finde.</p>
               <p>This is (faire Shepherdeſſe) the tragedie of my life, this is the cauſe of my death, and this the proceſſe of al mine ils: In which ſo ſad diſcourſe if I haue been too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the fault is thine, ſince my vnwilling toong, by thy importunate requeſtes was conſtrained to tell it. And that which now I craue of thee (gentle Shepherdeſſe) is, that thou wouldeſt not trouble thy ſelfe to applie any remedies to my ſorrowe, nor comfort my cares, nor to ſtop the teares, which with ſo iuſt cauſe are due to my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall greefe. <hi>Marcelius</hi> hauing ended his ſorrowfull hiſtorie, began to make a moſt dolefull complaint, and to ſigh ſo forciblie, that it was great pittie to beholde him. Faine would
<hi>Diana</hi> haue told him tidings of his <hi>Alcida,</hi> which was not long ſince in her companie; but to performe her worde, which ſhe had promiſed not to diſcouer her vnto him, and alſo for that ſhe ſawe it would but haue tormented him more, by giuing him notice of her, who extremely hated him, helde her peace: And rather wiſhed him, to comfort himſelfe by entertaining an aſſured hope and confidence of his future gladnes, ſince ſhe herſelfe doubted not before it was long to ſee him very ioyfull in the preſence of his beloued Miſtreſſe. For if it was true (as he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that <hi>Alcida</hi> went wandring vp and downe in the companie of Shepherdeſſes and Nymphes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhe could not then (ſaide
<hi>Diana</hi>) bee long vnhidden from him, and ſo ſhe promiſed him to cauſe an enquirie and ſearch to bee made in the ſtrangeſt, remote, and ſolitarie places, and in the fieldes moſt frequented by them, but eſpecially charging him to haue a regarde to his owne life, and promiſing him to performe that which ſhe had offered. For which vnexpected curteſies,
<hi>Marcelius</hi> yeelding her infinite thankes, would haue taken his leaue, ſaying, that after a fewe daies he thought to returne thither againe, and to giue her a full account of al thoſe accidents that in ſeeking out
<hi>Alcida</hi> might happen vnto him. But <hi>Diana</hi> ſtaying him, ſaide. I will not be ſo great an enimie to mine owne content, to let thee goe out of my companie, but would rather (bicauſe I ſee my ſelfe forſaken of my husband <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> as thou art of thy <hi>Alcida</hi>) haue thee ſtaie and eate (if it pleaſe thee) a little of my ſimple cheere to refreſh thy ſelfe, who haſt (it ſeemes) no ſmall need thereof. And after when the ſhadowes of the trees and hils waxe greater, we will both go home to our village, wherewith that reſt (which continuall greefe will ſuffer vs to take) we will paſſe the night away, and in the morning betimes haſten vs towardes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of chaſte <hi>Diana,</hi> where the ſage Lady <hi>Felicia</hi> makes her abode, whoſe ſecret wiſedome will miniſter remedies to our painfull paſſions. And bicauſe thou maieſt the better enioy the rurall conuerſation and countrey plaines of the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes of our fieldes, it ſhall be beſt for thee, not to change thy paſtorall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, nor to diſcouer thy ſelfe, but to name thy ſelfe, and in apparell and faſhions liue wholly like a Shepherd.
<hi>Marcelius</hi> being willing to do that, which <hi>Diana</hi> told him, did eate a little of that which ſhe had taken out of her neat ſcrip, and quenched his thirſt with the ſauorie water of the cleere fountaine, both which were ſo needfull for him, as for one that trauelling all the day before, had neither eaten nor drunke: and then they went on their waies towards the village. But they had not gone foorth <pb n="400" facs="tcp:23115:203"/>many paces, when in a little thicket not farre from the path way, they heard the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding voices of certaine Shepherds, who ſweetely ſung to the tune of their mery Bagpipes, and bicauſe <hi>Diana</hi> was delighted much in muſick, ſhe praied <hi>Marcelius</hi> to go to the place where they were, who being come neere vnto the wood, <hi>Diana</hi> knew the Shepherds
<hi>Tauriſus</hi> and <hi>Berardus,</hi> two great corriuals in her loue, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wont to go togither in company, and ſing in emulation the one againſt the other. Whereupon <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Marcelius</hi> not entring into the place where the Shepherds were, but yet hiding themſelues behinde certaine Okes ſo nigh, that they might heare the ſweetenes of the muſicke, liſtened to the Shepherds ſongs, being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of them at all, who though they knew not the cauſe and effect of their ſongs, was ſo neere at hand, yet diuining (as it were) that their enimie was harkening vnto them, by cleering vp their paſtorall voices, and making moſt delicate and different ſtops with them, they began to ſing this Eglogue following.</p>

               <p>Now did the light begin to giue place to darknes, and the countrey villages with their domeſticall fires began to ſmoke apace, when the Shepherds being neere to their towne made an ende of their ſinging.

At which wordes ſhe ſeemed to make ſo greeuous complaints, and indeed to be ſo ſorrie, that in the end ſhe told them all, that earely in the morning ſhe was purpoſed to go to <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple, to enquire of ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> ſome newes of her husband
<hi>Delius.</hi> They were all well content, that ſhe ſhould go, and offered her all the fauour and helpe they could in her iourney, but the intent therof was for no other end but to ſee <hi>Syrenus,</hi> whom ſhe knew aſſuredly to be there. Wherefore with many thankes ſhe remained verie glad, that her determination had ſo good ſucceſſe; and ſo with hope of her future ioy, ſhe gaue ſome reſt that night to her wearied bodie, and felt in her heauie hart a touch of vnwoonted pleaſure and content.</p>

All which is verified by <hi>Marcelius</hi> diſgraces, ſince Fortune wrought ſo hard a conceite in his betrothed
<hi>Alcidas</hi> breſt, that <pb n="407" facs="tcp:23115:206"/>ſhe was forced to giue credite to ſuch a ſuſpicion, that (though moſt falſe) ſhe held for an aſſured, or at leaſt an apparant ground of his inconſtancie, whereof enſued the hating of her husband, who loued her deerer then his owne life, and who in any thing had neuer offended her. Heereupon it may be gathered, how ſtrong and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a preſumption ought to be, to make a wiſe and diſcreete perſon giue faith and credite to it, ſince this, that had but a colour of certaintie was ſo farre indeede from the truth of the matter.

               <p>The delicate voice and excellent graces of <hi>Diana,</hi> ſurmounted farre the praiſes of the faireſt and moſt skilfull Shepherdeſſes of her time. And the quauers and fine conceits wherewith ſo ſweetely ſhe brake her voice, and adorned her ſongs, made her to be the more admired: For they were ſo rare and ſingular, that they rather ſeemed to be fetcht from ſome maieſticall court, then knowen in the homely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. The which ought not to be ſo much wondred at, nor thought ſo ſtrange, ſince Loue is able to make the ſimpleſt Shepherds diſcourſe of high and learned matters, eſpecially if it finde a liuely wit and ſpirit, which in thoſe paſtorall cottages is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wanting. But as the enamoured Shepherdeſſe was now ending her ſong, about that time that the cleere Sunne began to leſſen the ſhadowes of the high hils, deſpiſed <hi>Marcelius</hi> taking his leaue of his paſtorall lodging, to come to the place where he had appointed to meete <hi>Diana,</hi> came downe from the hill aboue, at the foote whereof ſhe was ſitting to attende him: whom when ſhe had eſpied a far off, ſhe held her peace, bicauſe he might not vnderſtand the cauſe of her griefe. When <hi>Marcelius</hi> was come to the place where <hi>Diana</hi> ſtayed for him, he ſaide vnto her. The cleere light of this day (faire Shepherdeſſe) which with the more reſplendant beames of thy ſhining beautic did ariſe, be as ioyfull and happie to thee, as to me moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, if in thy good company I paſſe it not away. Truely I am aſhamed to ſee, that my ſlownes hath made thee ſtay heere all alone ſo carefull for my comming; but this is not the firſt fault that (faire <hi>Diana</hi>) thou muſt pardon me during the time that I ſhall conuerſe with thee. As that pardon ſhould be vaine (anſwered <hi>Diana</hi>) where there is no fault; ſo thou art not to be blamed for any ſuch ſmall care, but rather the earneſt deſire that I had to riſe ſo early, and to come hither, where I haue paſſed away the time in ſundrie fancies, and in thinking of the effects which belong to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled minde. But here is no time nor place for vs to ſtay, ſince the deſire I haue to be at <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple is great, though the way is very ſhort: as alſo for that the morning being ſomewhat freſh, we may before the Sunne begins to powre downe his beames <pb n="410" facs="tcp:23115:208"/>with greater heat, begin to take our iourney, the better to refreſh our ſelues, &amp; in the heate of the day to reſt our wearied bodies. When ſhe had ſaide thus, they both went on their way, croſſing ouer a thicke wood that was before them, and for light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their iourney, began to ſing that which followeth.</p>

               <p>They ſung this ſong and many more, the which hauing ended, they were nowe out of the wood, and then they began to walke ouer a pleaſant and flowrie meade, which cauſed <hi>Diana</hi> to vſe theſe words. They are no doubt maruellous and ſtrange things, which the induſtrie of man hath inuented in populous and great cities, but yet thoſe, which nature hath produced in the wide and ſolitarie fieldes, are more to bee admired. For who woulde not woonder at the liuely greene of this wood? and not be amazed at the beautie of this goodly meadow? For, to beholde the diuerſitie of coloured flowers, and the pleaſant melodie of chirping birdes, is a thing ſo full of content and delight, that the glorious pompe and wealth of the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt and moſt famous Court is not comparable to it. There is indeed (ſaid
<hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>) in this pleaſant ſolitude great ſtore of content and ioy, and namely for thoſe that are free from paſſions of loue, ſince they may lawfully, and when they liſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſuch rare ſweetenes, and abundant pleaſures. And I am certaine, that if Loue, (which is now ſo much my mortal enimy, remaining in theſe ſequeſtred places) had in the village where I was of late, giuen me halfe the grief, which now I feele, my life durſt neuer abide it, ſince with ſuch like delights I coulde not haue mitigated the crueltie of my torment. To this <hi>Diana</hi> anſwered not a word, but putting her ſnowe white hande before her eies, and therewith ſupporting her golden head, ſhe ſtaied a great while very ſadde and penſiue: and after ſending foorth now and then a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and painefull ſigh, ſaid thus. Then woe is me (vnfortunate Shepherdeſſe) that can finde no remedie ſufficient to comfort my ſorrowes, when thoſe, which take away from others a great part of their paine, doe bring to me a continuall and burning greefe. I can now <hi>(Marcelius)</hi> no longer hide the paine which I ſuffer, the force whereof, though it compels me to publiſh it, yet for one thing I am bound to thanke it, that it conſtraines me to tell it in ſuch a time &amp; place, where thou art one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent, ſince thy noble minde and experience in like paſſions will not (I hope) condemne it for a meere &amp; trifling follie, eſpecially when thou knoweſt the cauſe thereof. I am (to be plaine with thee <hi>Marcelius</hi>) tormented with the like greefe that thou art, and am alſo forgotten (as thou art) of a Shepherd called <hi>Syrenus,</hi> of whom in times paſt I was greatly beloued. For cruell Fortune, which ouerturneth humane intents, married me to
<hi>Delius</hi> (enforced more by the hard commandement of my parents, then by mine owne will) and to my great greefe, made me a bondſlaue to ſuch a husband, the intollerable thought of whoſe continuall iealouſie (beſides the ſufferance of many other greefes more) is onely ſufficient to kill this miſerable ſoule. Whoſe iniurious ſuſpects I could be content yet to ſuffer, if I might but enioy the preſence of <hi>Syrenus;</hi> who, taking a iuſt occaſion by my forced marriage to forget me, forſooke our towne, (bicauſe he would not ſee me) and (as I vnderſtande) is in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:23115:209"/>the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> whither we are now going. Whereupon thou maieſt imagine what kinde of life I leade, being alwaies troubled with the iealouſie of my husband, and tormented with the abſence of my louer. Then <hi>Marcelius</hi> ſaid. I cannot chuſe but pittie thy greefe, nowe I know it (gracious Shepherdeſſe) and am ſorrie that I haue not heard it till now. God grant I may neuer enioy any happie content, if I wiſh it not as well to thy hart as to mine owne. But bicauſe thou knoweſt how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Loues arrowes are, &amp; with what ſmall partialitie they hurt the ſtouteſt harts, and moſt free and vertuous mindes, then bluſh not to manifeſt his wrongs, ſince it ſhall neuer the more be an empeachment to thy good name, but an occaſion to make me eſteeme the better of thee. And that which comforts me heerein is, that I knowe, that the torment of thy husbandes iealouſie (a greater corſiue to the hart then the abſence of the thing beloued) will ſuffer thee to take a little reſt, ſince
<hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who is following the flying Shepherdeſſe, ſhall now be ſeparated from thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Enioy therefore the time, and occaſion that Fortune preſents thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thy ſelfe, for it ſhall be no ſmall eaſe vnto thee, to paſſe away the abſence of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus,</hi> being now free from the importunous trouble of thy iealous husband. I wold not eſteem theſe iealouſies ſo hurtful to me (ſaid <hi>Diana</hi>) if
<hi>Syrenus</hi> had them aſwel as <hi>Delius,</hi> bicauſe I would then thinke that they had their foundation and beginning of loue. For it is manifeſt, that they that loue, would be glad to be loued againe, &amp; muſt eſteem the iealouſie of the thing beloued, to be good &amp; lawfull, ſince it is a manifeſt token of loue, ſpringing from loue, incident to loue, &amp; euer acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with it. And for my ſelfe I am able to aſſure thee, that I neuer thought my ſelfe more in loue, then when I was a litle iealous, &amp; neuer iudged my ſelf to be iealous, but when I was aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that I was moſt in loue. To the which <hi>Marcelius</hi> replied thus, I neuer thought that a paſtoral plainnes was able to alledge ſuch wiſe reaſons, in ſo difficult a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereupon I muſt needes condemne that for an olde approoued errour, that maintaines, that onely in cities and in the court the fineſt wits, and exquiſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits do dwell, when I finde them as well to be amongſt the thicke woodes, and in countrey and plaine cottages. Yet for all this I will gainſay thy opinion, whereby thou wouldſt ſeeme to prooue that iealouſie is the meſſenger and companion of loue, as if loue could not be where iealouſie is not ioyned with it. For though there are fewe louers but are a little iealous; yet we muſt not therefore ſay, that the Louer that is not iealous, is not a more perfect and truer louer. For he rather ſheweth (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exempt from iealouſie) what valour and force he hath in loue, and the qualitie of his deſire, which is pure and cleere, and not troubled with the miſte of iealous imaginations. Such an one was I (with modeſtie be it ſpoken) in my moſt happie and paſſed times, and ſo highly then priſed my good Fortune, that with my publike verſes I did manifeſt the ſame. And amongſt many other times that <hi>Alcida</hi> maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to ſee me ſo much in loue, and free from iealouſie, I tooke in hand on a time to write this Sonnet to her to that effect.</p>

               <p>The pleaſure that my <hi>Alcida</hi> tooke when I rehearſed this Sonnet to her, was ſo great (perceiuing thereby the integritie of my loue) that a thouſand times ſhee would ſing it, knowing that I had well pleaſed her fanſie with it. And truely (faire Shepherdeſſe) I hold it for a great errour, that ſuch a horrible monſter as iealouſie is, ſhould be accounted a good thing, as to ſay, that it is the token of Loue, and that it is not but in an enamoured hart. For by this aſſertion we may ſay, that a feauer is good, bicauſe it is a token of life, for it is neuer but in a body moſt likely to liue. But both are manifeſt errours, ſince iealouſie affoords no leſſe paine then a feauer: For it is a plague of the ſoule; a frenſie diſturbing the thoughts; a madnes that weakens the bodie; an anger conſuming the ſpirits; a feare abaſing the minde, and a furie that fils the will with folly. But bicauſe thou maiſt the better iudge of iealouſie to be moſt abhominable, imagine the cauſe of it, and thou ſhalt finde that it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but a little feare of that which is not, nor ſhall be, a vile contempt of ones owne deſerts, and a mortall ſurmiſe, which cals the faith and ſinceritie of that which is beloued, in doubt and ſuſpition. The pangs of iealouſie with words (gentle Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe) cannot be decyphered: for they are ſuch that do infinitely exceed in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and qualitie the paines, that are incident to loue. For all the reſt (ſauing they) may be conuerted in the end to a great ſweetnes, and content. And as the burning thirſt in the hotteſt day makes the cold and freſh fountaine water to taſte more ſweete and ſauorie, and as the danger and garboiles in warre and ſedition, make vs eſteeme the more of quietnes and peace; ſo the torments of Loue ſerue vs for grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleaſure, whenſoeuer any ſmall fauour is graunted vnto vs, and when we enioy but the leaſt content and happines. But this frantike iealouſie powres ſuch bitter poyſon into mens harts, that it ſpoiles and driues away all delights that harbour in it.

               <p>O how true was his opinion, how ſure was this concluſion? For in very truth this peſtilent iealouſie leaues not one part of the ſoule whole, nor the leaſt corner of the hart vnſearched, where any ſmall delight may hide it ſelfe. There is no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent in Loue, where there is no hope; and hope will neuer be there, where iealouſie is a meane betweene them both. There is no ſtedfaſt pleaſure where iealouſie is, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which is not conſumed with it, and no griefe but iealouſie torments vs with it. The enraged furie of poyſoned iealouſie is ſo extreme, that it grieueth the hart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, to heare the praiſes of the thing beloued, and would neuer haue the perfections of that which one loueth neither ſeene nor knowen of any but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, offering great iniurie by meanes hereof to the woorthines of that gentilitie, that holds him in captiuitie. And the iealous man doth not onely liue in this ſlauery and paine, but to her alſo whom he loueth, he giueth ſuch inceſſant griefe, that more he could not giue her, if he were her mortall enimie. Wherefore it is verie cleere, that a iealous husband (like thine) would rather haue his wife ſeemefoule and loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the world, &amp; that ſhe might be neuer ſeene, nor praiſed; no, not by the moſt virtuous and modeſt mindes. What griefe is it for the wife to haue her honeſty co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a falſe ſuſpect? What greater puniſhment, then without all reaſon to be locked vp in a ſecret corner of her houſe? What hart breake ſorrowe with auſtere words, &amp; ſomtimes with vnſeemely deeds to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually checked? If ſhe be merie, her husband thinks her diſhoneſt; if ſhe be ſad, he imagines himſelfe lothſom in her eie; if ſhe be muſing, he iudgeth her ful of fanſies; if ſhe looke on him, he thinks ſhe deceiues him; if ſhe lookes not on him, he thinkes ſhe hates him; if ſhe vſe any daliance with him, he thinkes it to be but fained; if ſhee be graue and modeſt, he thinkes her a counterfaite; if ſhe laughes, he thinkes her to be looſe; if ſhe ſigh, he counts her naught: And in the end iealouſie conuerteth euerie thing that is poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with it, to an endleſſe griefe and miſerie. Whereupon it is verie cleere, that there is no paine in the world like to this, and neuer out of hell came fouler <hi>Harpyes</hi> to contaminate and putrifie the ſweete and ſauourie foode of an enamoured ſoule: wherefore care not greatly <hi>Diana</hi> for the abſence of iealous
<hi>Delius,</hi> for it auailes thee not a little to make thee ſuffer the paine of Loue more gently. To this <hi>Diana</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Now am I thorowly aſcertained, that this paſſion which thou haſt ſo liuely depainted, is a moſt vgly and horrble thing, which deſerues not a place in amorous harts; and alſo beleeue, that this was the verie ſame griefe that tormented <hi>Delius.</hi> But I muſt tel thee by the way
<hi>(Marcelius)</hi> that I neuer meant to defend the like grief, &amp; that neuer it found harbour in my breſt: for as I neuer thought amiſſe of
<hi>Syrenus</hi> worthines and deſerts; ſo was I neuer tormented with ſuch like paſſion and follie, as thou haſt told of, but I had onely a certaine kinde of feare to be reiected in reſpect of another. And in this ſuſpition I haue not beene much deceiued, for to my great griefe I haue tried <hi>Syrenus</hi> forgetfulnes. This feare, ſaid <hi>Marcelius,</hi> ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be properly termed iealouſie, which is rather an ordinarie paſſion in the beſt and wiſeſt louers. For it is verified, that that which I loue, I eſteeme &amp; hold it for good, and thinke it deſerues to be beloued: which being ſo, I am afraide leaſt another might know the goodnes, and worthines of it, &amp; ſo loue it like my ſelfe. And ſo it fals out, that a louer <pb n="415" facs="tcp:23115:210"/>is put betweene hope and feare. That which the one denies him, the other doth promiſe him; and when the one doth caſt him downe, the other lifts him vp againe. And in the ende, the wounds that feare makes in this contentious quarrell, hope heales againe, vntill one of the two remaines conqueror. And if it happen that feare ouercomes hope, the louer then becomes iealous; but if hope conquers feare, then the louer liues in a ioyfull and happie eſtate. But in the time of my good fortune I had euer ſo ſtrong and ſure a hope, that feare was vnable, not onely to ouercome it, but durſt neuer attempt to aſſaile it; whereby, I euer enioyed ſo great delight, that in exchange of that, I neuer cared to be troubled with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual griefes. And I was ſo greatly in her fauor, that I ſuſtained my hope in ſuch firmnes, that there was no grief that came from her part, that I accepted not for a ſingular ioy, &amp; pleaſure. I accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her cruelties, courteſies; her diſdaines, daliances; her angrie anſwers, amiable promiſes. <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Marcelius</hi> going on their waies, had theſe and diuers other ſpeeches togither. And hauing paſſed ouer the greene meade in ſweete communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and going by the ſide of a little hill, they entred into a pleaſant wood, where the thicke Sicamours did ſpread abroad freſh and coole ſhadowes. There they heard a paſſing cleere voice, which ioyned with the tune of a ſweete harpe, ſounded forth ſtrange melodie; and comming neer to hearken to it, they might perceiue, that it was the voice of a Shepherdeſſe, that ſung in maner following.</p>

<pb n="416" facs="tcp:23115:211"/>(faire Shepherd and Shepherdeſſe) I neuer receiued ſo great contenment that might be compared with this in ſeeing you now, ſince the time that I was vniuſtlie forſaken of my cruell husband; which is ſo great, that though continuall greefe compels me to ceaſeleſſe plaints, yet will I make a pauſe of them a little while to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy your peaceable and diſcreete companie. To this <hi>Marcelius</hi> anſwered. I praie God I may neuer ſee my torments ceaſe, if that it greeues me not to ſee thine, and the ſame maieſt thou alſo beleeue of faire
<hi>Diana,</hi> whom thou ſeeſt in my companie. The Shepherdeſſe hearing <hi>Dianas</hi> name, running vnto her, did with the greateſt gladnes that might be, embrace her, ſhewing a thouſand louing ſignes, and making the moſt on her in the world, bicauſe ſhe was deſirous long ſince to knowe her, for the great report that ſhe heard of her wiſedome and beautie.
<hi>Diana</hi> maruelling to ſee herſelfe ſo entreated by a Shepherdeſſe, whom ſhe knewe not, requited her yet with like curteſies againe, and deſiring to know who ſhe was, ſaide vnto her. The great fauours that thou haſt done me, and the pittie which I take of thy complaints, make me deſirous to know what thou art, wherefore tell vs (faire Shepherdeſſe) thy name, and diſcourſe vnto vs the cauſe of thy greefe, bicauſe that after thou haſt tolde it, thou ſhalt ſee how our harts will helpe thee to paſſe it away, and our eies readie to bewaile it. The Shepherdeſſe then with a gracious ſpeech began to excuſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, from telling the ſubſtance of her owne fall, yet vrged in the ende by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate requeſtes, ſhe ſat downe againe vpon the graſſe, and began thus to ſaie. By the report of <hi>Seluagia</hi> that was borne in my towne, and in thine too faire <hi>Diana,</hi> which is now married to the Shepherd <hi>Syluanus,</hi> thou haſt beene told (I thinke) of the vnfortunate name of <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> that is now beginning to tell her ſorrowfull tale. And I thinke that ſhe tolde thee at large when ſhe was in thy towne, howe againſt my will I deceiued her in the Temple of
<hi>Minerua</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and how by my owne deceite I was ouertaken; then perhaps ſhe hath alſo tolde thee how I fained to loue <hi>Montanus</hi> her mortall enimie, to be reuenged of
<hi>Alanius,</hi> who for the loue that he did beare her, forgot me quite, and how this fained loue with the riper knowledge of his vertues, and accompliſhments fel out at laſt ſo true, that by means of it, I ſuffer this intolerable ſorrow &amp; greefe, which euen now I complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of. Therefore paſſing on farther in the hiſtory of my life, thou ſhalt vnderſtand, that when <hi>Filenus</hi> father to <hi>Montanus</hi> came ſometimes to my fathers houſe about certaine of his affaires, and bargaines that he had with him for flockes of ſheepe, and had eſpied me on a time, although ſomewhat aged, yet he was ſo extreemely enamoured of me, that he became almoſt out of his wits. A thouſand times a daie he wooed me, and euery hower reckoned vp to me his greefes, but all in vaine, for I would neither harken vnto him, nor regard his wordes. Yet bicauſe he was a man of more ſufficiencie, and of fewer yeeres then many other in his caſe, I did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither forget him, and the rather for his ſonne <hi>Montanus</hi> ſake, whoſe loue had made me now his captiue before. The old man knew not of the loue, that <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did beare me, for he was alwaies ſo carefull and dutifull a ſon, and ſo diſcreetly handled the matter, that the father had not any notice thereof, fearing mightilie (if it had beene knowne) his fathers diſpleaſure, and that with bitter and angrie wordes he might haue iuſtly corrected him for it. And as wiſely did the father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale from his ſonne <hi>Montanus</hi> his owne follie; for, the better to chaſtiſe and amend what he thought amiſſe in his ſonne, he was very vigilant not to diſcouer his owne and greater faults. Although for all this he neuer ceaſed with continuall ſuites to ſollicite my loue, &amp; importuned me to take him for my husband. He diſcourſed
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:23115:211"/>to me a thouſand odde matters, and made me as many great offers: he promiſed me many coſtly garments, rich iewels, and ſent mee many letters, thinking by thoſe meanes, if not to ouercome me, at leaſt to mollifie my hard refuſals. He was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd in his flouriſhing age no leſſe commended for al youthful ſports, then cunning in all paſtorall exerciſes, one that could tell a ſmooth tale, and with great wiſedome and diſcretion bring his purpoſe to good effect. And bicauſe you may the better beleeue me, I will rehearſe vnto you a letter that once he wrote vnto me, the which although it altered my minde nothing, yet it greatly contented me, and thus it ſaid.</p>

               <p>Theſe and many other letters and ſongs he ſent me; the which, if they had wrought their effect ſo much as my delight, he might then perhaps in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit haue thought himſelfe a happie man, and I haue beene by this time an ill mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wife. But there was not any thing able to blot <hi>Montanus</hi> image out of my hart, who apparantly alſo ſatisfied my will with like words and deeds. We paſſed our liues away certaine yeeres in this ioy, vntill we thought with holy marriage to accompliſh our happie daies, and reſt. And though <hi>Montanus</hi> would haue tolde his Father of it before, to haue ſhewed the dutie of a good ſonne, yet he would not do it, when I told him, how hardly his Father would thinke of it, by reaſon of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="420" facs="tcp:23115:213"/>deſire that he had to marrie me himſelfe: Hauing therefore greater reſpect to the contentment of his owne life, then to the dutie he owed his Father, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him priuie, we performed our vnluckie marriage. Which was done by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of my Father, in whoſe houſe there were great feaſtes made in ſolemnitie of it, beſides other paſtimes, as dancing, plaies, &amp; ſuch great ſports, that the noiſe of them was bruted in all the countrey towns about. Whereupon the louing old man vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his own ſon had deceiued him of his loue, he became ſo incenſed againſt vs both that he hated vs like death, &amp; therfore would neuer after that ſee vs, if he could otherwiſe chooſe. On the other ſide there was a certaine Shepherdeſſe of that towne called
<hi>Feliſarda,</hi> that died almoſt for the loue of <hi>Montanus,</hi> whom (in regard of his great loue to me, and of her bad conditions and declining age) he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer abide: When ſhe perceiued that
<hi>Montanus</hi> had married me, ſhe had almoſt hanged her ſelfe for griefe, ſo that by our vnfortunate marriage we got vs two mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enimies. The wretched old dotard, becauſe he would diſinherit his ſonne, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to marrie a yoong and faire wench, to haue had children by her. But though he was rich, yet did not any Shepherdeſſe of our towne loue him,
<hi>Feliſarda</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, who, bicauſe ſhe thought by theſe meanes to enioy the diſhoneſt loue of <hi>Montanus</hi> (the which ſhe bare yet freſh in memorie) married with old <hi>Filenus.</hi> And being now his wife, ſhe practiſed diuers waies to winne <hi>Montanus</hi> to her loue, and eſpecially by meanes of a maide ſhe had, called
<hi>Sylueria,</hi> ſending him word, that if he would condiſcend to her will, ſhe would make an attonement betweene his Father and him, offering him beſides many great rewards, &amp; gifts. But ſhe could neuer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his minde, nor peruert his chaſte intent: Seeing her ſelfe therefore ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, ſhe began to beare ſuch mortal hatred to <hi>Montanus,</hi> that by and by ſhe inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated his Father againſt him; and not content with this, wrought more ouer this vile piece of treacherie againſt him. For ſhe in ſuch ſort ouercame <hi>Syluerias</hi> minde with flatterie, gifts, good cheere, and other fauours, that ſhe was content to do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe commanunded, although it had beene to the preiudice of <hi>Montanus,</hi> whom ſometimes ſhe reſpected greatly, for that ſhe had beene a long time ſeruant in his Fathers houſe. Both of them agreede ſecretly togither vpon that they had to doe, and vpon the hower of putting it in practiſe: Whereupon <hi>Sylueria</hi> went out of her towne, and comming to a forreſt neere to the riuer <hi>Duerus,</hi> where <hi>Montanus</hi> was fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his ſheepe, ſhe came to talke with him ſecretly, as though ſhe had beene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled much in minde about the weightieſt matter in the world, ſaying. Ah, <hi>Montanus,</hi> how wiſe wert thou in deſpiſing thy wicked Stepdames loue, though I my ſelfe by her importunate requeſt did what I could to bring thee to it. But ſince I know what hath paſſed, ſhe ſhall neuer make me any more the meſſenger of her diſhoneſt luſts. I haue ſeene, and know certaine things by her, which touch thy Fathers credit and thine too neere, and ſuch, that, if thou kneweſt them (though thy Father is ſo cruell to thee) in ſuch a caſe thou would'ſt not care to leeſe thy life for ſafegard of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I tell thee no more but this, bicauſe I know thee to be ſo wiſe and diſcreete, that I neede make no longer diſcourſe vnto thee. <hi>Montanus</hi> was amazed at theſe wordes, ſuſpecting by and by ſome diſhoneſt tricke of his Stepmother: But bicauſe he would be thorowly informed of the matter, he prayed
<hi>Sylueria</hi> to tell him all that ſhe knew concerning that matter. The more ſhe was entreated, the more ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, making it verie daintie, and no leſſe dangerous to diſcouer ſo ſecret a thing; but in the end ſatisfying his requeſt, and her owne deſire, ſhe told him a notable and cunning lye, ſaying. Bicauſe it is a thing that ſo greatly toucheth thy credit, &amp; <hi>Filenus</hi> 
                  <pb n="421" facs="tcp:23115:213"/>my Maſters good name, I will therefore tell thee truely what I know, hoping that thou wilt tell none in the worlde, that this ſecret treacherie was diſcouered by me. Thou muſt therefore knowe, that <hi>Feliſarda</hi> thy ſtepmother is working a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace againſt thy father, with a certaine Shepherd, whoſe name I will not tell thee, bicauſe thou maieſt heereafter knowe him, if thou wilt: for if thou wilt come this night, and follow me where I will leade thee, thou ſhalt finde the adulterer and the traytereſſe togither in
<hi>Filenus</hi> houſe: for ſo they haue appointed, bicauſe
<hi>Filenus</hi> lieth this night at a Farme he hath, by reaſon of ſome buſines there, &amp; cannot come home again before to morrow at noone. Wherfore look wel about thee, &amp; at eleuen of the clocke at night come to mee, for I will bring thee in, where thou maieſt doe that, which may turne to thine own credit, thy fathers honor, &amp; perhaps greatly to thine owne profit by obtaying pardon at thy fathers hands. This tale <hi>Sylueria</hi> told ſo ſmoothly, and with ſuch cunning diſſimulation, that <hi>Montanus</hi> was reſolued to put himſelfe in the greateſt danger to be reuenged of him, who ſhoulde offer any diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his father. And ſo the vile and wicked <hi>Sylueria</hi> very glad that this deceit which <hi>Feliſarda</hi> hatched, had ſo good ſucceſſe, went home againe, where ſhe tolde
<hi>Feliſarda</hi> her Miſtreſſe what was agreed on betweene
<hi>Montanus</hi> and her. Nowe had the darke night ouerſpred the earth with her blacke mantell, when <hi>Montanus</hi> being come to the village, tooke a dagger with him which his vncle <hi>Palemon</hi> the Shepherd had giuen him, and iuſt at eleuen of the clocke went to <hi>Filenus</hi> his fathers houſe, where <hi>Sylueria</hi> was ſtaying for him, as ſhe had appointed. O wicked treaſon, the like neuer ſeene, nor heard of before! Oh trayterous wickednes, ſuch as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought of before! She tooke him by the hand, and going very ſoftly vp a paire of ſtaires, ledde him to the chamber doore where <hi>Filenus</hi> his father, and <hi>Feliſarda</hi> his ſtepdame were a bedde togither, and when ſhe had ſet him there, ſhe ſaide vnto him. Now thou art come to the place <hi>Montanus,</hi> where thou muſt ſhew that thou haſt courage and no abiect minde, that is requiſite in ſo good a cauſe: goe into this chamber, and there thou ſhalt finde thy mother a bed with the adulterer. When ſhe had ſaide ſo, ſhe ranne away, as faſt as euer ſhe could. <hi>Montanus</hi> being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with <hi>Syluerias</hi> falſhood, gaue credite to her words, and in a furie plucking his dagger out of the ſheath, brake open the chamber doore with a thruſt of his foote, like a mad man with theſe loud exclamations ruſhed into it, ſaying: Here muſt thou die (traytour) by mine owne hands: now ſhall the ſtrumpet
<hi>Feliſardas</hi> foule loues helpe thee nothing at all: And ſpeaking theſe words, he was ſo wroth, that he knew not who he was that lay in the bedde, and thinking to haue ſlaine the adulterer, he lifted vp his arme to ſtabbe his Father as he lay a bedde. But yet good Fortune awoke the old man, who knowing his ſonne by the light that was there, thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that for the auſtere words &amp; vnkind diſgraces, which he had done him, he came to kill him; wherefore lifting himſelfe quickly out of the bedde, with holding vp his hands he ſaide. O my ſonne! what crueltie is this that makes thee the butcher of thine owne Father? For Gods ſake remember thy ſelfe, and ſpill nor nowe my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, nor ende my life before the appointed hower from aboue doth come. For if I haue heeretofore vſed any rigour againſt thee, heere vpon my knees I craue pardon for it, with proteſtation, that from hencefoorth I will entreate thee as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly and gently as any father in the world may vſe his ſonne. When <hi>Montanus</hi> perceiued the treacherie that was wrought, and the danger that he had almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, by killing his owne Father, he ſtoode there ſo aſtoniſhed, that his hart and arme ſo failed him, whereby the dagger fell out of his hands and neuer felt it. Being <pb n="422" facs="tcp:23115:214"/>thus ſtriken in a maze, he could not vtter a worde; but aſhamed and confounded in his owne enterpriſe, he went out of the chamber, and out of the houſe wonderful ſorrie for the treacherie that <hi>Sylueria</hi> had buzzed into his eares, and for that which he had almoſt done, but that his fortune was the better.
<hi>Feltſarda,</hi> who knew all the matter before, and how it would fall out, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Montanus</hi> come into the chamber, ſhe lept out of the bed, and ranne into another inward chamber, and loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the doore after her, ſaued her ſelfe from her ſonne in lawes furie. But when ſhe ſaw her ſelfe free from danger (for now <hi>Montanus</hi> was gone out of the houſe) ſhee came into the chamber againe where <hi>Filenus</hi> was yet ſhaking for feare, and then ſhe incenſing the Father againſt the Sonne, with loude vociferations began thus to ſay vnto him. Now <hi>Filenus,</hi> thou knoweſt well what kinde of Sonne thou haſt, and now canſt tell if it be not true which I haue ſo often told thee of his wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and nature. O cruell wretch! O vile Traytour <hi>Montanus!</hi> why doe not the heauens confound thee? Why doth not the earth ſwallow thee vp? Why do not the wilde beaſts deuour thee? Why do not men perſecute thee to death? Accurſed be thy marriage, thy diſobedience, thy loues, and thy
<hi>Iſmenia,</hi> that hath brought thee to this barbarous crueltie, and to commit ſo horrible a ſinne. Traytour as thou art, thou doſt not puniſh
<hi>Alanius,</hi> who to thy ſhame and diſgrace, hath too familiar com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie with thy <hi>Iſmenia</hi> vſing her diſhoneſtly, and whom ſhe loues more then thy ſelfe; and careſt not to kill thy owne Father, who with tendernes of thy life, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit hath euer made account of thee. Bicauſe he gaue thee good counſell, would'ſt thou therefore kill him? O woefull Father! O vnfortunate gray haires! O grieuous old age! What fault didſt thou euer commit, that thine owne ſonne ſhould kill thee for it, euen he, whom thou haſt begotten, brought vp, and for whom thou haſt paſſed a thouſand cares? Plucke vp thy hart now; leaue of thy fatherly loue; giue place to iuſtice; let him be duely puniſhed: for, if he, which perpetrated ſuch wicked cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, hath not his deſcrued puniſhment, diſobedient ſonnes will not be afraide to do the like, nor thine owne hereafter to murder thee once againe with his owne hands. Old <hi>Filenus</hi> full of feare, griefe, and deſpite, hearing the ſpeech that his wife told him, and conſidering his ſonnes treaſon, tooke ſo great diſpleaſure at it, that taking vp the dagger that <hi>Montanus</hi> had let fall, early in the morning he went to the market place, &amp; there aſſembling the chiefeſt men of the towne, &amp; the Iuſtices togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after many teares and ſobs, ſaid thus vnto them. I inuoke God for witnes (moſt worthie Shepherdes) that the diſcourſe, which I muſt tell you, torments my ſoule ſo much, that I am afraide it will flye out of my bodie before I haue told it out. Let not any therefore thinke me cruell or vnnatural, by comming to publiſh my ſonnes wickednes openly in this place, ſince it is ſo ſtrange and deteſtable, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt puniſhment that I am able to giue him, is not ſufficient for the enormitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The which for that I am vnable my ſelfe to remedie it, I will lay open before your eies, that you may ſee, how iuſt and needfull a thing it is to giue him condigne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and to forwarne all other ſonnes by his grieuous example. Needleſſe it is to tell you, with what tender loue and affection I haue brought him vp, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully I haue kept him; with what diligence I haue inſtructed him in commendable qualities; what thoughts I haue ſuffered for him; what good counſell I haue giuen him, and how mildly I haue chaſtiſed him. To my great griefe he married <hi>Iſmenia;</hi> and bicauſe I found fault with him for it, in lieu of being reuenged of <hi>Alanius</hi> the Shepherd, who (as all the countrey knowes) liues diſhoneſtly with his wife
<hi>Iſmenia,</hi> turned his anger towards me, and this night would haue done me to death. For <pb n="423" facs="tcp:23115:214"/>this laſt night he found the meanes to get into the chamber where I was a bed with my wife <hi>Feliſarda,</hi> and with this naked dagger would haue killed me: And had done it, but that God did cut off his ſtrength, and abated it in ſuch ſort, that being halfe aſtoniſhed and afraide, he went out from thence, not able to put his damnable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in practiſe, leauing the dagger (that fell out of his hands) in the chamber. This is the true report of that which this laſt night paſſed, whereof you may be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by my louing wife. But bicauſe I certainly know that my ſonne <hi>Montanus</hi> would neuer haue committed ſo foule a deed againſt his Father, if his wife
<hi>Iſmenia</hi> had not perſwaded him to it, I therefore beſeech you all to conſider well of this matter: Firſt, that my ſonne may be ſufficiently puniſhed for his wicked attempt; and then, that falſe
<hi>Iſmenia,</hi> eſpecially for the treacherous counſell ſhe gaue her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as alſo for her diſhoneſt loue, and life that ſhe leades with <hi>Alanius,</hi> may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe receiue due correction. <hi>Filenus</hi> had ſcarce ended his tale, when there aroſe ſuch a noiſe amongſt the people, that all the towne ſeemed to haue ſuncke: And the harts of all the Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes were ſo much altered at theſe words, that they conceiued a mortall hatred againſt <hi>Montanus.</hi> Some ſaide, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to be ſtoned to death; others, to be throwen into the deepeſt place of the riuer <hi>Duerus;</hi> others, that he ſhould be caſt forth to be deuoured of hungrie woolfes, ſo that there was not one almoſt amongſt them all, who allotted not his doome and manner of his death. It mooued them alſo not a little to deſpite to heare that which
<hi>Filenus</hi> falſely reported concerning my life: but they were ſo incenſed with anger and hate againſt <hi>Montanus,</hi> and his pretenſes, that they had no leyſure to thinke of mine. When
<hi>Montanus</hi> vnderſtoode how his Father had openly before all the towne accuſed him of this deed, and of the hurly burly and awaite, that was laide to catch him, he fell into a woonderfull deſperation. And beſides this knowing what his Father had told of me before them all, he tooke ſuch a deepe conceit and griefe thereat, that the like was neuer heard of. From hence did all my ſorrowes riſe, this was the cauſe of my perdition, and here did my painfull life begin. For my beloued <hi>Montanus</hi> knew that in times paſt I had loued <hi>Alanius,</hi> and was beloued of him againe; and imagining that old and mortified loues might oftentimes be reuiued, &amp; ſeeing
<hi>Alanius</hi> (whom now for his ſake I had quite forgotten) to be in loue with me as much as euer he was, by making daily ſuites to me for my loue, with thoſe kinde of paſtorall feaſts and ſports, that louers are woont to pleaſe their Shepherdeſſes withall, he vehemently ſuſpected, that the falſe report which his Father <hi>Filenus</hi> had told of me was true; and the more he thought of it, the more he beleeued it to be ſo indeed: In ſo much that waxing almoſt mad and deſperate for the treacherie that
<hi>Sylueria</hi> had wrought him, and for that which he ſuſpected I had done him, he fled from the towne and countrey thereabouts, and ſince was neuer more heard of. And I then, who knew of his departure and the cauſe thereof, by the report of certaine Shepherds his friends, whom he fully acquainted with his vnfortunate eſtate, left alſo our town to ſeeke him out, and while I liue will neuer leaue ſeeking, vntill I haue found my deere husband, to acquite my ſelfe of this crime which he ſuſpectes, although I ſhoulde die by his owne handes for my labour. It is a good while ſince I haue gone vp and downe wandring and enquiring after him, and for all that I haue ſought in the cheefeſt townes, and amongſt all the Shepherdes and cottages, Fortune neuer yet gaue me any notice of my <hi>Montanus.</hi> The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt accident, that in theſe my trauels chanced vnto mee, ſince I forſooke my towne, was, that I found the traytereſſe <hi>Sylueria,</hi> who knowing the voluntarie exile <pb n="424" facs="tcp:23115:215"/>of <hi>Montanus,</hi> went vp and downe following, to tell him the plot and drift of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret trecherie that ſhe had done him, and to aske him forgiuenes for it, being verie penitent that ſhe had committed ſuch abhominable wickednes. But as yet till then ſhe had not ſpoken with him, and when ſhe ſawe me, ſhe told me openly howe the matter ſtoode, which was no ſmall eaſe vnto my minde, to know the maner how we were betraied. I thought with mine owne handes to haue killed her, though I was but a weak woman, yet I did it not, bicauſe it lay in her only to helpe my greefe by confeſſing her owne wickednes. I praied her, to ſeeke out my beloued <hi>Montanus</hi> in all the haſte ſhe could, to certifie him of the matter, and how it ſtoode, and ſo I left her to ſeeke him out ſome other way. I came hither to day to this woode, where being inuited by the pleaſantnes of the place, I reſted mee to paſſe the heate of the day away. And ſince that Fortune (for my great comfort) hath brought you hither, and that it is now the hotteſt part of the day, I beſeech you let me enioy your gracious companie, while the heate of the ſunne ſhall laſt. <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Marcelius</hi> were glad to heare the hiſtorie that <hi>Iſmenia</hi> tolde them, and to knowe the cauſe of her greefe. It pleaſed them alſo well to heare the diſcourſe of her life, who then gaue her ſome comfort to eaſe her greefe, promiſing her all the fauour and helpe, that they might poſſiblie beſtow on her for remedie of her paine and trauels. They praied her alſo to go with them to
<hi>Felicias</hi> pallace, bicauſe it was moſt like that there ſhe ſhould finde out ſome kind of comfort to make her glad againe. And they both thought good to paſſe the time away there, while the heate of the Sunne did laſt, as <hi>Iſmenia</hi> requeſted them. But bicauſe
<hi>Diana</hi> was very skilfull in that ground, &amp; knew very well the woods, fountaines, forreſts, and the pleaſant and ſhadowed places of it, ſhe told them, that there was not farre from thence a more delightfull and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant place then that was, for it was not yet full midday: So that all three of them ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, went a little way, and came by and by to a forreſt, where <hi>Diana</hi> led them, which was as pleaſant, coole, and delightful a place, as any of thoſe hils, or fieldes that euer was with fame renowned in the paſtorall <hi>Arcadia:</hi> There were in it faire and greene Sicamours, Sallowes, Aſhes, Byrch, and Beech trees, which round about the brinks of the chryſtalline fountaines, and in euery part thereabout, being ſoftly blowen with a coole and ſweete winde, made a pleaſant and gentle noiſe. There the aire did ſo ſweetely reſound with the tuned melodie of the little birdes, which went skipping vp and downe the greene boughes, that it cheered vp the minde with a gracious kinde of welcome. It was couered all ouer with greene and ſmall graſſe, amongſt the which were many faire and coloured flowers, which painting the place with knots in many places, did with their ſweete ſinell recreate the moſt ſorrowfull and melancholike ſpirits. There were the Hunters woont to finde Heardes of feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Harts, wilde Goates, and of other little beaſts, in which games and ſports they tooke no ſmall paſtime and delight. They came into this forreſt following
<hi>Diana</hi> their guide that went in firſt, for ſhe went before to ſeeke out a little thicke groue of trees, that ſhe had marked out in that place (where ſhe was woont to reſort) to reſt and refreſh herſelfe many times. And they had not gone farre, when <hi>Diana</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere to the place, that ſhe thought the moſt pleaſant of all the wood, and where ſhee minded to haue paſſed away the heate of the daie, putting her finger to her mouth, ſhe made ſignes to <hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> to come on ſoftly without making any noiſe. The reaſon was, bicauſe ſhe heard amongſt thoſe thicke trees certaine Shepherds ſinging. By their voices they ſeemed to be <hi>Tauriſus</hi> and <hi>Berar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> both extremely tormented in purſute of her loue, as it is ſaide before. But bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="425" facs="tcp:23115:215"/>ſhe would be more ſure of it, ſtealing on neerer vnto them betweene certaine buſhes, ſhe was harkening to them, to ſee if ſhe knew them, and ſhe perceiued that they were the very ſame, and that they had in their companie a faire yoong gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and a gallant and woorthie gentleman, both which (although they ſeemed to be ſomewhat troubled in minde, and wearied by much trauell) ſhewed neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in their geſture and diſpoſition notable tokens of valour and vertue. After ſhe had viewed who they were, ſhe went backe againe bicauſe ſhe woulde not be ſeene. And now was <hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> come, and all three togither began to ſit them downe behinde certaine Haſels, where they might not bee ſeene, but where they might diſtinctly heare the Shepherds ſongs, whoſe voices reſounding ouer all the forreſt, made a ſingular ſweete melodie, as you ſhall heare in the Booke that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth.</p>

               <p>About this time the yoong Gentleman, and Gentlewoman that were harkening to the Shepherds ſongs, did cut them off, and gaue them many thankes for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and recreation, which with ſo ſweete muſicke they had giuen them. And after this the Gentleman turning to the Gentlewoman ſaid. Didſt thou euer (ſiſter) in the magnificent and ſtately Cities heare muſicke that pleaſed the eare, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the minde like this? Truely (ſaide ſhe againe) theſe paſtorall and country ſongs, being full of ſimplicitie and plainnes, pleaſe me more, then the delicate voices ſet togither with curious skill, and full of newe inuentions and conceits in the braue pallaces of Kings and Princes. And when I thinke this melodie to be better then that, you muſt the rather beleeue it, bicauſe I haue been preſent at the beſt muſicke that in any Citie of the world or Kings Court, was euer heard. For in that happie time, when <hi>Marcelius</hi> was a ſutor to our ſiſter <hi>Alcida,</hi> he did ſome nights ſing to the tune of his Lute ſo ſweetely, that if <hi>Orpheus</hi> made ſo ſolemne muſicke, I did not maruell then if the Birdes, and Beaſtes did follow him, and that he brought backe his deere wife <hi>Euridice</hi> from darke hell. Ah
<hi>Marcelius,</hi> where art thou nowe? Ah where art thou <hi>Alcida?</hi> Ah moſt hapleſſe woman that I am, how often doth For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſurcharge my memorie with obiects of greefe, when ſhe ſees me enioy the leaſt content and pleaſure in the worlde? <hi>Marcelius</hi> heard the talke of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the Damoſell, which were with the Shepherds behinde the ſhrubs and buſhes, and when he perceiued that they named him and
<hi>Alcida,</hi> he began to bee ſomewhat altered. He ſcarcely beleeued his owne eares, and was doubting with himſelfe whether it was another
<hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Alcida</hi> whom they named. He roſe vp by and by out of his place, and to cleere himſelfe of all doubt, comming neerer, he knewe that they were <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda,</hi> brother and ſiſter to <hi>Alcida:</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ran ſuddenly to them, and with open armes, and abundance of teares, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times embracing <hi>Polydorus,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Clenarda,</hi> he ſtoode a great while before hee could ſpeake for inward greefe. <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda</hi> wondring at this noueltie, could not coniecture what accident it was, bicauſe
<hi>Marcelius</hi> going in a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds habite, was vnknowne vnto them, vntill his ſobs and teares giuing him leaue, he ſaide. O deere brother and ſiſter, care not nowe for my ill fortune paſte, and to come, ſince I am the happieſt man in the world in ſeeing you. Ah, why is not
<hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> in your companie? Is ſhe perhaps hidden in any part of this thicke woode! O let me know ſome newes of her, if you can tell me any, to eaſe my cruell greefe, and to ſatisfie my deſire! In ſpeaking theſe wordes, they knewe <hi>Marcelius</hi> and embracing him very affectionately, and weeping for pleaſure and greefe, they ſaide vnto him. O happie day! O vnexpected ioy! O deere brother of our ſoules, what cruell For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath bin the cauſe, that thou doſt not enioy the company of <hi>Alcida,</hi> nor we her ſight? Why doſt thou diſſemble thy ſelfe with this new habite? O cruell fortune, in the end there is not full content of any good.
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> on the other ſide, ſeeing that
<hi>Marcelius</hi> had ſo on the ſudden gone to the place where the Shepherds did ſing, went after him, and founde him talking with
<hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda,</hi> as you <pb n="430" facs="tcp:23115:218"/>haue heard. When <hi>Tauriſus</hi> and <hi>Berardus</hi> ſaw <hi>Diana,</hi> the ioye, that at ſo ſweete and ſudden a ſight they tooke, cannot be tolde. And ſo <hi>Tauriſus</hi> ſhewing a maruellous kinde of gladnes in his hart, and words, ſaid vnto her. This is no ſmall fauour of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (faire
<hi>Diana</hi>) to make her, that continually flies our companie, by vnexpected and happie chances to come ſo often where wee are. That is not the cauſe of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune (woorthie Shepherds) ſaide <hi>Diana,</hi> but rather bicauſe you are ſo excellent in ſinging &amp; playing on your inſtruments: for there is no place of pleaſure where you are not, and where your ſweete muſicke &amp; ſongs are not heard. But now, ſince I am come hither, though ignorant of your being heere, and that the parching Sunne is now in the higheſt way, I ſhall be very glad to paſſe away the heate of the daie in this pleaſant place, and in your good companie: and though it ſtandes me vpon to go quickly to <hi>Felicias</hi> pallace, yet will I not thinke the time long to ſtaie heere with you to take part of the coole and greene graſſe, and to harken to your delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full muſicke. Prepare your ſelues therefore to ſing and plaie, and to all kinde of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt myrth, for it will not become this place, and braue aſſemblie to be without ſuch kinde of pleaſure. And you Gentleman, and faire Gentlewoman, ſurceaſe your teares a while, bicauſe you ſhall haue time enough heereafter to tell to each other your Fortunes and aduentures, and to bewaile, or reioice at the ill or good ſucceſſe of them. All of them liked well of <hi>Dianas</hi> ſpeech, and ſo they ſat them downe vpon the fine greene graſſe rounde about the Fountaine. That was the pleaſanteſt place in all the wood, and more then any of thoſe, that were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated by the cleere Bagpipe of <hi>Neapolitan Syncerus</hi> in famous <hi>Parthenia.</hi> There was in this place a broad quadrant fortie paces of euerie ſide, and compaſſed about with a great number of thick trees. So that in a maner of a walled caſtle, they, that went to recreat themſelues in it, could not go but by one way into it. It was couered all ouer with greene graſſe and ſweete flowers, neuer troden downe with the feete of ſheepe or goates, nor mangled with their ſlicing teeth. In the mids thereof was a goodly cleere fountaine, which, iſſuing foorth at the foote of an olde Oake, roſe vp fower ſquare and deepe; not made by skilfull hand, but placed there by prouident nature to ſuch purpoſes, as with the abundance of the waters it made there a delightfull meeting, which the Shepherds named the <hi>faire Fountaine.</hi> The brinkes of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine were of white ſtone ſo euen, that none would haue thought, but that it was made with artificiall hand, if the naturall ſtones growing there, did not deceiue his ſight, which were faſtened in the ground as hard, as the craggie rocke, and flint in the wilde mountaines. The water that came out of that ſweete fountaine, iſſuing out of two narrow pipes, did water the graſſe and trees about it, making them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to ſpring, and fertill, and keeping them in a pleaſant and fine verdure. This <hi>faire Fountaine</hi> for euerie goodly pleaſure about it was ſo much viſited of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds and Shepherdeſſes, that there was neuer wanting about it paſtorall mirth and ioy. Who likewiſe had it in ſuch veneration and account, that when they came to it, they left their flockes without, bicauſe the cleere and ſweete waters might not be troubled, nor the fine little meadow fed, nor troden downe by the hungrie and careleſſe ſheepe. About this fountaine (as I ſaide) they all ſat downe, and taking neceſſarie foode out of their ſcrips, did eate it more ſauourly, and with greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, then the greateſt Lords their varietie and number of daintie diſhes. At the end of which repaſt, as <hi>Marcelius</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda</hi> on the other, were greatly deſirous to heare, and make relation of their paſſed fortunes,
<hi>Marcelius</hi> firſt began to ſay to the other two in this ſort. It is great reaſon (brother <pb n="431" facs="tcp:23115:218"/>and ſiſter) that I know ſomthing of your aduentures and accidents, ſince laſt I ſaw you, bicauſe ſeeing not your Father <hi>Eugerius,</hi> nor your ſiſter
<hi>Alcida</hi> in your company, it makes a great alteration in my hart, not knowing the cauſe thereof. To whom <hi>Polydorus</hi> anſwered.</p>
               <p>Bicauſe this goodly place might not be iniured (me thinkes) with reports of dole and ſorrow, and that theſe Shepherds with hearing of our hard haps might not be alſo greeued, with the feweſt words (that poſſible may be) I will report the many miſeries and diſgraces that we haue receiued of Fortune.</p>
               <p>After that I was hindered by the mariners from leaping into the ſciffe, hauing attended fit time and occaſion haue deliuered my father
<hi>Eugerius</hi> (being faint and halfe dead) out of the dangerous ſhip, and that of force I was conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine (to my great griefe) with my fearefull father in it, the ſorrowfull olde man was ouercome with ſuch bitter anguiſh and paine, as may be imagined of a louing father, who in the end of his aged yeeres, ſeeth the violent perdition of his owne life and of his louing children. He tooke no heed now to the maine blowes, which the cruell waues did beate againſt the ſhips ſides, nor to the rage of the angrie windes that did bluſter on euerie ſide, but caſting his eies to the little boate wherein thou wert <hi>Marcelius</hi> with <hi>Alcida</hi> and
<hi>Clenarda</hi> (which at euerie flote of the hoiſting bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes ſeemed to turne ouer) the more he ſaw it going from the ſhip, the more his hart burſt in peeces. And when he loſt ſight of you, he was in danger of yeelding vp his decaied ſpirits. The ſhip driuen on by the crueltie of Fortune, went floating vp and downe the maine ſeas fiue daies togither, after that we parted; at the ende of which time, the Sunne going downe towards the Weſt, we were in ken of lande. At ſight whereof the Marriners were verie glad, as well for recouerie of their loſt hope, as alſo for knowing the coaſt whither the ſhip was driuen. For it was the moſt fertill countrey and moſt abounding in all ſorts of pleaſures, as far as the Sun doth heate with his beames: In ſo much that one of the Marriners taking a Rebecke out of a cheſt, with the which he was wont to cheere vp himſelfe in long and dangerous voiages, began to play and ſing to it in manner following.</p>

               <p>The faire maides ſong, and our ſupper ended al at one time, which being done, we demanded of <hi>Clenarda</hi> what had hapned vnto her ſince our laſt departure from her, who tolde vs what villanie
<hi>Sartofano</hi> offered vnto her, in what caſe <hi>Alcida</hi> was left, of thy impriſonment, her captiuitie, and in the ende all that thou knoweſt at large. We bewailed bitterly our hard Fortunes, which when the Fiſherman hearde, hee comforted vs vp as well as he could, and tolde vs eſpeciallie how that in theſe parts there was the ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> whoſe wiſedome was enough to remedie our greefes; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs alſo notice of <hi>Alcida,</hi> and of thee, to the which our deſires principally ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And ſo paſſing away that night the beſt we coulde, aſſoone as morning came, leauing the marriners there that came with vs in the ſhippe, we three alone went our waies, and not long after came to the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> where the wiſe Lady <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> keepes her court. We ſawe there the admirable temple, the moſt pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, the ſumptuous pallace, there we knew the great wiſedome of the moſt graue Ladie, and other things that filled vs ſo full of woonder, that wee haue ſcarce anie breath to tell them againe. There we ſawe the faireſt Nymphes, examples of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, many Lordes and Ladies, Shepherds, and faire Shepherdeſſes, and eſpeciallie one Shepherd named <hi>Syrenus,</hi> whom euery one there made great account of: To him and many more beſides, did ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> giue diuers remedies for their loues and greefes. But the pleaſure, which but hitherto yet ſhe hath done vs, is, to keepe our Father <hi>Eugerius</hi> in her companie, commanding vs to goe towardes theſe parts, and that we ſhould not returne vntill we had found out ſome content or good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. And for the great ioy that wee haue receiued by thy ſight, I thinke wee haue good occaſion to go backe againe, eſpecially for that we haue left there our Father
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:23115:220"/>all alone and comfortleſſe: I know well that in ſeeking out <hi>Alcida</hi> is no ſmall eaſe to his carefull thoughts; but bicauſe Fortune hath not theſe manie daies giuen vs any newes of her, we ſhall take the better courſe to returne backe againe, then to ſuffer our old Father to be depriued ſo long of our companie. After
<hi>Polydorus</hi> had made an end of his diſcourſe, euery one was aſtoniſhed to heare ſuch ſtrange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; and after
<hi>Marcelius</hi> had wept for <hi>Alcida,</hi> he made a breefe relation to
<hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> and <hi>Clenarda</hi> of that which had hapned to him ſince he ſawe them laſt. When <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> heard
<hi>Polydorus</hi> make an end of that ſorrowfull hiſtorie, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to go the ſooner to <hi>Felicias</hi> court, the one bicauſe ſhe knew aſſuredly that <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi> was there; the other, bicauſe ſhe conceiued a certaine hope (hearing of the woonderfull wiſedome of
<hi>Felicia</hi>) to haue alſo ſome redreſſe for her greefes. Being therefore poſſeſſed with this deſire, <hi>Diana</hi> (although ſhe was minded to recreate herſelfe certaine howers in that pleaſant place) altered her determination, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming more of <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſight, then of the greene hew of that goodly and fine wood. Whereupon riſing vp, ſhe ſaid to <hi>Tauriſus</hi> and <hi>Berardus.</hi> Sit yee (merrie Shepherds) ſtill, and enioy the delight and ſweetenes of this pleaſant place, for the deſire that I haue to go to <hi>Dianas</hi> temple, will not let me ſtay any longer here. We are right ſorie to forſake ſo delightfull a ſhade &amp; ſo good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, but we are forced to follow our Fortune in this behalf. Wilt thou be ſo diſcurteous (faire Shepherdeſſe) (ſaid
<hi>Tauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>) to depart ſo ſoone from our dolefull eies, and to let vs ſo ſmall a while enioy thy ſweet ſight &amp; ſpeeches? Theſe Shepherds haue great reaſon (ſaid <hi>Marcelius</hi> to <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>) to dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch a gentle requeſt, &amp; it is therfore as great again that their demand be not denied them in reward of their conſtant faith &amp; true loue, which deſerues to enioy thy companie a little while in this pleaſant place, eſpecially when thou haſt time enough to be at <hi>Dianas</hi> temple before the Sunne wil hide his light. All of them were of his opinion, and therefore <hi>Diana</hi> woulde not ſeeme diſcourteous to anie of them, but ſitting down again in her place, ſhe would not rather pleaſe herſelfe, then diſpleaſe ſo braue a companie as that was. Now then louing Shepherds (ſaid <hi>Iſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to <hi>Berardus</hi> and
<hi>Tauriſus</hi>) ſince faire <hi>Diana</hi> doth not denie vs her preſence, it is not reaſon that you denie her your ſongs. Sing iolly Shepherds, that in your ſongs &amp; roundelaies ſhewe ſo great cunning, and ſo perfect loue, being for the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in al the townes and countries heereabout, and moouing the hardeſt harts with the other to loue and pitie. True (ſaide <hi>Berardus</hi>) all harts, ſauing
<hi>Dianas,</hi> and began to weepe, and <hi>Diana</hi> to ſmile. Which when the Shepherd ſawe, to the ſweete ſound of his pipe with the ſwelled teares ſtanding in his eies, he ſung a gloſſe vpon this Dittie.</p>

<hi>Felicia,</hi> whoſe Nymphe I am, will be verie glad of your good companie for the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſignes of your good deſerts, which by your perſonages you ſeeme to teſtifie. And now ſince that the Sunne hides it ſelfe in the Weſt, I will goe backe with you thither, where you ſhall be welcomed and feaſted in the beſt ſort that may be. They gaue her moſt hartie thankes, and went with her towards the Temple, recouering great hope by the words and promiſes of the Nymphe: and although <hi>Polydorus</hi> and
<hi>Clenarda</hi> had beene before in <hi>Felicias</hi> houſe, yet they neuer remembred that they had knowen or ſeene her before: And the reaſon was, bicauſe of the great number of Nymphes that the wiſe Ladie had euer at her commaundement, diuerſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in diuers parts of her Court. Therefore they asked her her name, &amp; ſhe told them that ſhe was called
<hi>Arethea. Diana</hi> asked her what newes ſhe knew in thoſe parts? And ſhe anſwered. The lateſt newes that is here, is, that not two howers ſince there came to <hi>Felicias</hi> houſe a ſtrange Ladie in habit of a Shepherdeſſe; the which, being ſeene by an ancient old man, that is alſo there, he knew her for his daughter; and becauſe ſhe had beene a long time wandring vp and downe the world, and thought to be dead, the ſudden ioy was ſo great that he receiued at her ſight, that it cauſed a great wonder amongſt all thoſe that were in the houſe. The olde mans name (as I remember) is <hi>Eugertus,</hi> and his daughters <hi>Alcida. Marcelius</hi> hearing theſe words, remained ſo ſenceleſſe with ioy and feare aſſayling him both at once, as any wiſe man may coniecture, and at laſt ſaid. O happie trauels, and fortunate troubles, which come to their ende with ſo proſperous accidents! Ah ah, and deſiring to haue paſſed on farther, his hart was ſo ouercome, and his toong ſo tyed, that in a traunce he fell downe to the ground. <hi>Diana, Iſmenia,</hi> and <hi>Clenarda,</hi> being next vnto him, tooke him vp againe, and with comfortable wordes of hope recouered his diſmayed ſoule: And ſo comming to himſelfe againe, he thanked them many times. <hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda</hi> were not a little glad at thoſe newes, ſeeing now that all their ſorrowes ſhould haue an ende by the happie comming of their ſiſter <hi>Alcida.</hi> And
<hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> were alſo verie ioyfull, as well for their companions good hap, as alſo for the hope they had of their owne good fortunes and helpe to receiue it at her hands, who wrought ſuch miracles and woonders. <hi>Diana,</hi> bicauſe ſhe would know ſomething of
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> ſaid thus vnto her. The great hope of content that thou haſt giuen me (faire Nymphe) by telling me of that, which is in
<hi>Felicias</hi> Palace for <hi>Alcidas</hi> comming, is not ſmall; but yet greater ſhould I haue, if thou wouldeſt tell me what Shepherds of account are there alſo. There are many woorthie Shepherds (anſwered
<hi>Arethea</hi>) but thoſe that I do beſt remember are <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia, Arſileus</hi> and <hi>Beliſa,</hi> and one other more principall then theſe, called <hi>Syrenus,</hi> whoſe vertues and deſerts
<hi>Felicia</hi> hath in great eſtimation; but he is ſuch an enimie to loue, that he makes all the reſt that are there to woonder at him.
<hi>Alcida</hi> is of like qualitie and condition, in ſo much that euer ſince ſhe came thither, both of them <pb n="452" facs="tcp:23115:228"/>haue not beene aſunder, diſcourſing of hate, obliuion, and diſdaine. And ſo I am verie certaine, that <hi>Felicia</hi> made them come to her Court to marrie them togither, being both of one minde, and their conditions being ſo ſemblable one to the other. For though he be but a Shepherd, and ſhe a noble Ladie, <hi>Felicia</hi> yet by her ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall powers can giue him valour, force, riches, and wiſedome, which is the trueſt nobilitie of all the reſt. And <hi>Arethea</hi> following on her ſpeech, turning to
<hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> ſhe ſaid thus vnto him. By this (Shepherd) thou ſeeſt how thy ioy is in hazard to fall to anothers lot; defer not therefore the time, bicauſe if thou commeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thou maiſt preuent
<hi>Syrenus</hi> of his match. But when <hi>Diana</hi> heard theſe words, ſhe felt the greateſt griefe that might be, and had ſhewed it by teares and outcries, if baſhfulnes and modeſtie had not beene an impediment to it.
<hi>Marcelius</hi> ſuffered the like paine for the ſame cauſe, and was ſo tormented with it, that he thought to haue dyed for verie anguiſh of minde. So that on knife wounded <hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Dianas</hi> hart, &amp; one iealouſie moleſted their ſoules: <hi>Marcelius</hi> feared
<hi>Alcidas</hi> marriage with <hi>Syrenus;</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> the marriage of <hi>Syrenus</hi> with <hi>Alcida.</hi> The faire Nymph knew
<hi>Marcelius</hi> &amp; <hi>Diana</hi> very well, &amp; thoſe that were with them, but ſhe diſembled it very cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly, as <hi>Felicia</hi> had told her how, telling <hi>Marcelius</hi> firſt a true tale, to giue him an vnexpected ioy; &amp; after a fained matter, to kindle his deſire, &amp; <hi>Dianas</hi> more; &amp; alſo bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by theſe bitter news, the gladnes that they afterwards receiued, might be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; more ſweet. Being now come to a broad &amp; moſt faire Court, which was before the palace gate, they ſaw a reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d old Lady co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming out of it, apparelled with a long gowne of black veluet, hauing a vaile on her head of white tynſell which hung down ouer her ſhoulders, being accompanied with three moſt faire Nymphes, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a moſt venerable and diuine Sybill. This Ladie was <hi>Felicia,</hi> and her Nymphes were <hi>Dorida, Cynthia,</hi> and <hi>Polydora.</hi> When
<hi>Arethea</hi> was come before her Ladie and Miſtreſſe (but firſt telling her company that ſhe was <hi>Felicia</hi>) ſhe kneeled downe and kiſſed her hands, and ſo did all the reſt. <hi>Felicia</hi> ſeemed to be verie glad of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and with a merie countenance ſaid vnto them. Woorthie Gentlemen, Lady, and famous Shepherds, although the ioy that I haue of your comming is great, yet the ſame that you ſhall reape by my ſight hereafter ſhall be no whit leſſe. But bicauſe you are ſomewhat wearie with your iourney, go and take your reſt, and forget your griefes, bicauſe you cannot want the firſt in my houſe, and the ſecond with my great knowledge ſhall be ſoone amended. They all humbly thanked her, ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues verie glad of their louing entertainment, and at laſt
<hi>Felicia</hi> left them. Shee made <hi>Polydorus</hi> &amp;
<hi>Clenarda</hi> to ſtay there, ſaying, that ſhe had to talke with them; and the reſt being guided by <hi>Arethea,</hi> went to a chamber in the rich Palace, where they were ſeaſted that night, and ſerued with all things needfull for their reſt. This houſe was ſo ſumptuous and magnificent, and ſo full of all kinde of ſtately riches, &amp; of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and coſtly gardens, that there was not any other comparable vnto it. But I will not trouble my ſelfe in making any particular recount of the beautie and riches of it, ſince that was declared at large in the firſt part of this worke. I will onely tell how <hi>Marcelius, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> were lodged in two chambers in the Palace, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all about with rich Tapiſtrie, curiouſly wrought with gold and ſiluer, lodgings vnacquainted to ſimple Shepherds. They were there entertayned with a daintie and plenteous ſupper, ſerued with plate of gold and criſtall, and when they went to ſleep layde in ſtately beds, whoſe bodies yet (though with trauell &amp; paine they were not a little wearied) with the ſoftnes &amp; ſweetnes of them, &amp; with the hope alſo that <hi>Felicia</hi> had giuen them, were inuited to a ſweet &amp; repoſed ſleepe. On the other ſide <hi>Felicia</hi>
                  <pb n="453" facs="tcp:23115:228"/>in company of her three Nymphes, and of
<hi>Polydorus</hi> and <hi>Clenarda</hi> (telling them by the way, that they ſhould ſay nothing of <hi>Marcelius, Dianas,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenias</hi> comming thither) went to a moſt pleaſant garden, where they ſawe
<hi>Eugerius</hi> paſſing the time away with his daughter <hi>Alcida. Don Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena, Syrenus, Syluanus,</hi> and <hi>Seluagia, Arſileus</hi> and <hi>Beliſa,</hi> and another Shepherd were ſitting togither a pretie way off them about a fountaine. <hi>Alcida</hi> had yet on the ſame paſtorall weedes, that ſhe came apparelled with that day to the pallace, but ſhe was preſently knowne by her brother and ſiſter. The ioy that the brother and two ſiſters had to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues altogither, and the gladnes that the father had to ſee himſelfe and them ſo well and happely met, moreouer the great affection wherwith they embraced each other, the louing talke that paſſed betweene them, and the ſundry queſtions that they asked of one another, cannot be with words nor writing declared.
<hi>Alcida</hi> was rapt with ioy to ſee her brother and ſiſter; but was gladder to ſee <hi>Polydorus,</hi> then <hi>Clenarda,</hi> for the great preſumption that ſhe had, that <hi>Marcelius</hi> went away with her, leauing her in the deſolate Iland all alone. But <hi>Felicia</hi> purpoſing to cleere all theſe miſtes &amp; errours, &amp; to make an end of ſo many hard fortunes, ſpake thus vnto them. Though Fortune hath neuer ſo much (faire <hi>Alcida</hi>) by many kindes of iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſhewed herſelfe thy mortall enimie, yet thou canſt nor denie, but that with this content, that thou now enioyeſt, thou art fully reuenged of all her wrongs. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the falſe imagination and deceit, wherein thou haſt liued hitherto, hating (without cauſe) thy louing <hi>Marcelius,</hi> if thou liueſt ſtill in it, is enough to alter thy hart, and to giue him much ſorrow and greefe; it ſhall be therefore very needfull for thee to ſhake off this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit &amp; iniurious fuſpicion out of thy mind. That which thou thinkeſt of
<hi>Marcelius,</hi> is cleane contrarie, bicauſe it was not his fault when hee left thee in the Iland, but the deceite of a vile traytour and of Fortune, who now to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the iniurie that ſhe hath done thee, hath brought thee hither vnto me, which thou ſhalt finde to be as true as my mouth (neuer accuſtomed to faine and lie) hath plainly and ſincerely told thee. Thy ſiſter <hi>Clenarda</hi> can make a large report vnto thee of all that hath paſſed about this matter, harken to her, and beleeue her words, bicauſe I ſweare vnto thee, that all that ſhe ſhall tell thee, is moſt true. Then
<hi>Clenar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> began to tell the whole matter &amp; how it hapned, purging
<hi>Marcelius</hi> and herſelfe, and reciting at large the treaſon and villany of <hi>Sartofano,</hi> and all the reſt, as you haue heard before. Which when <hi>Alcida</hi> heard, ſhe thought herſelfe very well ſatisfied, and then the long hatred, which ſhe bare to <hi>Marcelius,</hi> went out of her hart with the deceit, the onely occaſion of it. And then the ſmothered loue, and hidden fire began to reuiue in her breſt, being cleerely ridde of her old ſuſpicion, as alſo by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe charming words that <hi>Felicia</hi> made in her ſoule, and being in that mind, ſhe ſaid vnto <hi>Felicia.</hi> Mine errour I acknowledge (moſt honorable and ſage Ladie) and the great benefite that you haue done me, by deliuering me from it. But if I loue now <hi>Marcelius</hi> (the miſte of vniuſt ſuſpect being driuen from mine eies) and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent as he is indeed, I ſhal neuer the more for this happines attaine to the top of that ioy which I hope for at thy hands; but ſhall rather be afflicted with ſo great greefe of minde, that to remedie the ſame, I ſhall ſtand in neede of newe fauours at thy gracious handes. It is a good token of loue (anſwered
<hi>Felicia</hi> againe) to take thought for the abſence of the beloued, but let not this greeue thy minde, for I will be carefull for thy contentment: Now hath the Sunne hidden his beames, and it is good time to take ſome reſt. Goe therefore with thy father and ſiſter to repoſe thy ſelfe, bicauſe we will to morrow take order for theſe affaires. When ſhe had thus
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:23115:229"/>ſaid, ſhe went out of the garden, and ſo did
<hi>Eugerius</hi> and his daughters, repayring to the chambers that
<hi>Felicia</hi> had appointed for them in her pallace, which were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from that where <hi>Marcelius</hi> lay, &amp; the reſt of his company.
<hi>Don Felix</hi> &amp; <hi>Feliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi> with the other Shepherdes and Shepherdeſſes taried a pretie while about the fountain, &amp; then went to ſupper, appointing to meet there the next morning follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing one hower before day, to take the freſh ayre of the morning. So therfore as the hope of the pleaſure of the next morrowes meeting made them paſſe away the night with ſleeping but a little, they roſe vp all ſo earely in the morning, that before the appointed hower they were ready at the fountaine with their tuned inſtruments. <hi>Eugerius</hi> with his ſonne and daughters aduertiſed of the muſicke, did alſo riſe vp, and went thither. They beganne to play and ſing, and to make much ſport and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime by the light of the Moone, which with a full and bright face gaue them as cleere light as if it had beene day. <hi>Marcelius, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> laie in two cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one ioyning to the other, whoſe windowes looked into the garden: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could not ſee the fountain thorow them, by reaſon of the high &amp; thick Laurell trees which were about it, yet might they heare well what they ſaide. So therfore when <hi>Iſmenia</hi> (lying awake) heard the noiſe they made, and the merriment and ſongs of the Shepherds, ſhe awaked
<hi>Diana,</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi> knocking at the wall that was betweene both their chambers awoke <hi>Marcelius,</hi> and ſo all of them went to their windowes where they were neither ſeene nor knowne. <hi>Marcelius</hi> gaue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue care, if he might perhaps heare <hi>Alcidas</hi> voice.
<hi>Diana</hi> did diligently liſten to heare her <hi>Syrenus. Iſmenia</hi> onely had no hope to heare her <hi>Montanus,</hi> bicauſe ſhe knew not that he was there. But yet her Fortune was better then ſhe was aware of, for at that very inſtant a Shepherd ſung to the ſound of his Baggepipe this Sextine that followes.</p>

               <p>It happened to <hi>Diana</hi> as to thoſe which hearken to their owne harmes; for in hearing <hi>Syrenus</hi> diſdainfull reſolution, ſhe conceiued ſo great griefe in her minde, that I am not able to expreſſe it, and therefore thinke it better to leaue it to the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſe men. Let it ſuffice you to know, that ſhe thought to haue dyed at that preſent time, and therefore it was verie needfull for <hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her vp, and to incourage her with ſuch good reaſons, as were ſufficient for ſuch an extreme griefe; one of them was in telling her, that the knowledge and skill that <hi>Felicia</hi> had (in whoſe houſe they were) was not ſo ſmall, but that it had reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died woes of greater paine and conſequence, as ſhe had ſhewed but a little before by <hi>Iſmenia</hi> as diſdained of <hi>Montanus.</hi> As they were thus talking togither, the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den morning beginning to diſcouer it ſelfe, the Nymphe <hi>Arethea</hi> came in to that chamber, and with a cheerefull countenance ſaid vnto them. I wiſh as fortunate and good daies to you (noble Gentleman &amp; faire Shepherdeſſes) as are due to your deſerts and vertues. My ſage Ladie <hi>Felicia</hi> hath ſent me hither to know, if you haue ſlept more contentedly this night then you were wont to do, and to bring you along with me into the garden, where ſhe hath to ſpeake certaine words with you. But you <hi>Marcelius</hi> muſt leaue of theſe Shepherds garments, and put on this apparell that I bring here, fitter for your calling and degree. <hi>Iſmenia</hi> would not ſtay for <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celius</hi> anſwer, for ioy of the good newes, but ſaid. The gladſome tydings that with thy ſweete ſight thou haſt brought vs this morning (O happie Nymphe) God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite for vs, ſince it lies not in our power to recompence ſo great a debt and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie. The content that thou wouldeſt know of vs, is not little, with being only in this houſe, and how much happier haue we beene in it this morning, when <hi>Marcelius</hi> and I haue recouered our liues welnie loſt before, and <hi>Diana</hi> no ſmall hope to the attayning of her deſires? But bicauſe we muſt obay the command of ſo great and wiſe a Ladie as <hi>Felicia</hi> is, let vs not delay the time to go into the garden, and let her wiſedome diſpoſe of vs at her beſt pleaſure. Then
<hi>Arethea</hi> tooke the apparell that <hi>Marcelius</hi> ſhould put on from another Nymphe that brought it, and with her owne hands helped to put it on, which was ſo rich, and garniſhed ſo brauely with gold and precious ſtones, that it was of infinit value. They went out of that quadrant, and all of them following <hi>Arethea,</hi> by one of the Palace gates they went into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. This Orchard of the one ſide was enuironed with an arme of a goodly riuer, of the other ſide of it ſtoode moſt ſumptuous and ſtately buildings belonging to <hi>Felicias</hi> Palace, and the other two ſides compaſſed about with two wals, curiouſly plaiſtered with Ieſmines, Woodbind, and other herbes and flowers paſſing delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the eie. But of the pleaſantnes of this place, it is more copiouſly entreated of in the fourth booke of the firſt part. Now after they were come into it, they ſaw how <hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> ſeparated from the other company, were togither all alone in a little meadow that was neere to the gate. There did <hi>Arethea</hi> leaue them, willing them to ſtay for <hi>Felicia</hi> there, bicauſe ſhe was to go againe to the Palace to tell that ſhe had done the thing, that was giuen her in charge.
<hi>Syluanus</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> that were there, knew <hi>Diana</hi> by &amp; by, and maruelled much to ſee her there. <hi>Seluagia</hi> knew
<hi>Iſmenia</hi> alſo, which was of her own towne, and ſo there was great courteſie between <pb n="459" facs="tcp:23115:231"/>them and many embracings, ioyfull to ſee each other there after ſo long a time. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia</hi> then with a merie countenance ſaid vnto them. Faire <hi>Diana</hi> is welcome, whoſe diſdaine was an occaſion to make <hi>Syluanus</hi> mine. And welcome alſo faire <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> who with thy deceit didſt giue me ſo much paine, that for remedie of it I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where I haue changed it into a happy eſtate. What good fortune hath brought you hither? That (ſaid
<hi>Diana</hi>) which we receiue of thy ſight, and that, which we hope for at
<hi>Felicias</hi> hands. O happy Shepherdeſſe! how glad am I of the content that thou haſt gotten here: God confirme thy fortune ſo proſperous, that thou maiſt enioy it many yeeres. <hi>Marcelius</hi> offered not to ſpeake any thing amongſt them, bicauſe he neither knew <hi>Syluanus</hi> nor
<hi>Seluagia.</hi> But whileſt the Shepherds were occupied about their congratulations and curteſies, hee was beholding a Gentleman and a Ladie, that hand in hand went walking vp and downe an Alley in the Garden, being verie merrie one with the other. He tooke a certaine pleaſure in beholding the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and his minde gaue him, that he had ſeene and knowne her before: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to cleere himſelfe of that doubt, comming to <hi>Syluanus</hi> he ſaid. Although it is a point of diſcurteſie to interrupt your friendly greetings, yet woulde I faine knowe (gentle Shepherd) what Lord and Lady thoſe are that walke there togither. Their names (ſaid <hi>Syluanus</hi>) are <hi>Don Felix,</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> husband and wife. Then
<hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> hearing <hi>Feliſmenas</hi> name, altered his countenance and ſaid. Tell me, I praie you, whoſe daughter <hi>Feliſmena</hi> is, and where ſhe was borne, if thou doſt perhaps knowe, bicauſe I care not ſo greatly to enquire of <hi>Don Felix.</hi> I haue heard her oftentimes tell (ſaid <hi>Syluanus</hi>) that ſhe was borne in <hi>Soldina</hi> the cheefeſt citie of all <hi>Vandalia,</hi> her father being called
<hi>Andronius,</hi> and her mother <hi>Delia.</hi> But I praie you Sir, do me the fauour to let me know what you are, and why you made this demand? My name (ſaide <hi>Marcelius</hi>) and all elſe that thou ſeekeſt at my hands, thou ſhalt knowe heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. In the meane time do me this curteſie, that ſince thou art acquainted with Lord <hi>Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> craue leaue of them that I may ſpeake a fewe words with them, bicauſe I would aske her a queſtion that may redounde (perhaps) to much ioy and good on both ſides. It likes me well (ſaid <hi>Syluanus</hi>) and then he went by and by to <hi>Don Felix</hi> and <hi>Feliſmena</hi> and told them, that a Gentleman not farre off would faine entreat with them in certaine affaires if they thought it not troubleſome vnto them. They ſtaied not a minute, but came to the place where <hi>Marcelius</hi> was. And after curteous ſalutations, <hi>Marcelius</hi> ſaid to <hi>Feliſmena,</hi> I enquired (faire Lady) of this Shepherd thy countrey, name, and parents, who told me that which by thine owne report he knowes concerning the ſame, and bicauſe I knowe a Gentleman which was borne in the ſame citie, who is alſo ſonne to a Lord (if I be not deceiued) whoſe name is like to thy Fathers; Tell me then (curteous Lady) if you haue anie brother, and what his name is, bicauſe (it may be) he is the ſame, whom I knowe. With this <hi>Feliſmena</hi> gaue a great ſigh and ſaide. O noble Gentleman! how much doth thy demand penetrate my hart? Know therefore, that I had a brother, borne with me at one birth, and being but a childe at twelue yeeres old, my father <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſent him to the king of <hi>Portugales</hi> court, where he liued many yeeres. This is as much as I can tell of him, and that which I told <hi>Syluanus</hi> and
<hi>Seluagia</hi> that are heere preſent, on a time at the fountaine of the Sicamours, after that I had deliuered the three Nymphes, and killed three Sauages in the meadowe of the Laurell trees. From that time hitherto I haue heard nothing of him, but that the king ſent him as Captaine into the coaſt of <hi>Africa:</hi> and bicauſe I haue a good while ſince wandred vp and downe the world, following mine owne deſtinies and fortune, I knowe not
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:23115:232"/>whether he be aliue or dead. Then <hi>Marcelius</hi> could not ſtay himſelfe any longer, but ſaid. I haue indeed (ſweet ſiſter <hi>Feliſmena</hi>) bin dead hitherto, bicauſe I haue wanted thy good company, and now am reuiued, in that I haue beene ſo happie a man to ſee thee. And in ſpeaking theſe wordes he louingly embraced her.
<hi>Feliſmena</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring well <hi>Marcelius</hi> kinde of geſture and his countenance in her minde, did now cleerely ſee that he was the ſame indeed, and ſo was vndoubtedly reſolued, that he was her owne brother. The ioyfull greeting that paſſed betweene the brother, ſiſter, and couſen, was great; and the gladnes that <hi>Syluanus</hi> and
<hi>Seluagia</hi> tooke to ſee them ſo happely mette togither, not ſmall. There were many louing ſpeeches exchanged, many teares of ioy and ſorrow powred out, many demands and queſtions, hopes reuiued, determinations concluded, and many wordes and things of ioy and reſt mutually ſpoken and done. They ſpent in theſe congratulations one whole hower, which was little enough for the large hiſtory &amp; accidents that they had to diſcourſe of after ſo long an abſence. But bicauſe they might better and more ſafely talke of thoſe matters, they ſat themſelues downe in that little meadow vnder a ranke of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camours, whoſe wreathed boughes loden with leaues, made a delightfull and coole ſhadow, defending them from the heat of the radiant ſunne, which was with ſome heate mounted vp the Hemiſpheare. Whileſt <hi>Marcelius, Don Felix, Feliſmena, Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanus,</hi> and the Shepherds were talking togither of theſe matters, at the other end of the garden neere vnto the fountaine (as it is ſaide before) were <hi>Eugerius, Polydo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Alcida,</hi> and <hi>Clenarda. Alcida</hi> had that day left of her paſtorall weedes as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia</hi> had commanded, and was now apparelled and adorned very richly with coſtly garments and iewels that ſhe willed ſhoulde be giuen her. But as <hi>Syrenus</hi> was alſo there, <hi>Montanus, Arſileus,</hi> and <hi>Beliſa,</hi> ſinging and ſporting togither, they maruell ouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie delighted <hi>Eugerius</hi> and his ſonne and daughters, that were harkening to them. And that which did moſt of all pleaſe them, was a ſong which <hi>Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Arſileus</hi> did ſing one againſt another in diſpraiſe and fauour of <hi>Cupid:</hi> For they ſung with an earneſt will and deſire in hope of a braue chriſtall cup, which <hi>Eugerius</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for a reward and prize to him that did ſing beſt. And ſo <hi>Syrenus</hi> to the ſound of his Rebecke, and
<hi>Arſileus</hi> to the tune of his rurall Baggepipe, began to ſing in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following.</p>

               <p>There was not one there amongſt them all but tooke great delight in the Shepherds ſongs. But <hi>Eugerius</hi> comming to giue his verdict, praiſe, and reward to him that had ſung beſt, could not ſo ſoone conclude of the matter: he ſtept aſide to <hi>Montanus</hi> to heare his opinion, whoſe iudgement was, that one had ſung as well as another. Then <hi>Eugerius</hi> turning to <hi>Syrenus</hi> and
<hi>Arſileus,</hi> ſaid. My opinion is (cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Shepherds) that you are equall in the ſubiect of this contention, and that, if old <hi>Palemon</hi> were reuiued, and made an indifferent iudge betweene you, hee could not confeſſe (I thinke) any ſuperioritie in your skill. Thou art
<hi>Syrenus</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to beare away the criſtall cup; and thou
<hi>Arſileus</hi> deſerueſt it as well, ſo that I ſhould offer you great wrong, if I did not define who is conqueror, and who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. To reſolue my ſelfe therefore of this doubt with <hi>Montanus</hi> opinion, I ſay <pb n="465" facs="tcp:23115:234"/>that to thee <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> is allotted the Criſtall cup, and to thee <hi>(Arſileus)</hi> this Calcedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian cup of no leſſe value, which worthily thou haſt wonne. To both of you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I giue cups of like value, both of them of account amongſt <hi>Felicias</hi> treaſure, and by her bountifull hands beſtowed on me. The Shepherds were well pleaſed at the wife iudgement, and rich rewardes of bountifull
<hi>Eugerius,</hi> to whom they gaue many thankes. But <hi>Alcida</hi> by this occaſion calling to minde her paſſed times, ſaid. If the deceitfull errour, wherewith I haue beene blinded ſo long, had endured till now, I would not then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent that <hi>Arſileus</hi> ſhould be rewarded equally with
<hi>Syrenus:</hi> But ſince I am now free from it, and wounded afreſh with the loue of my betrothed <hi>Marcelius,</hi> for the paine which I ſuffer for his abſence, I like well of that which <hi>Syre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> did ſing; and for the ioy and ſweete delight which I expect, I alſo commend
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſileus</hi> ſong. But take heed careleſſe <hi>Syrenus,</hi> that theſe complaints which thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of <hi>Diana,</hi> be not like to thoſe wherewith I blamed <hi>Marcelius,</hi> bicauſe thou maiſt not repent thee of thy hardnes of hart and diſdaine, as I haue done.
<hi>Syrenus</hi> ſmiled at this and ſaid: What greater blame may be laide vpon that Shepherdeſſe, who after ſhe had forſaken me, married her ſelfe to a iealous, peruerſe, and vnfortunate husband. Then <hi>Alcida</hi> anſwered. Vnfortunate indeed he hath beene enough, ſince he caſt his eies vpon me: and bicauſe it comes fit to the purpoſe, I will tell thee that, which yeſterday (by reaſon of <hi>Felicias</hi> diſcourſes and affaires with me) I could not declare vnto thee, when as we were talking about
<hi>Dianas</hi> matters: and to this end eſpecially, bicauſe thou mighteſt forget all iniuries paſt, and ſhake off thy wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obliuion, when thou ſhalt vnderſtand of the ſtrange and vnluckie accident, that by my contempt befell to miſerable <hi>Delius.</hi> I haue told thee before, how I was tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ſinging with <hi>Diana</hi> at the fountaine of the Sicamours, and how iealous <hi>Delius</hi> came thither, and ſorrowfull
<hi>Marcelius</hi> after him in a Shepherds habit, at whoſe ſight I was ſo grieued, that I fled from him inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently into a wood that was hard by. But when I came to the other ſide of the wood, I heard a far off a voice that ſtill cryed, <hi>Alcida,</hi> Oh <hi>Alcida,</hi> ſtay, ſtay: which made me to thinke that <hi>Marcelius</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me; and bicauſe I would not fall into his hands, I ran as faſt as I could away. But by that which afterwards happened, I knew that it was <hi>Delius,</hi> husband to
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> that came running after me. And bicauſe I had run a great way, and began to be wearie, I then went ſo eaſily, that he followed me in ſight. I knew him, and ſtaied to know what he would haue, not thinking once of him, nor of the cauſe of his comming. And when he was before me, what by the faintnes of his running, and by the anguiſh of his minde that troubled him, he was not able to vtter one word. At the laſt with rude and ill formed reaſons he ſaid, that he was in loue with me, praying me after his homely manner to loue him againe, and many other things (I know not what) which ſhewed his little wit, and ſimple behauiour. To tell the very truth I laughed at him, and the beſt I could, endeuoured to comfort him, and to make him forget his folly, but it auailed nothing; for the more I diſſwaded him from it, the more foole he was. In faith (Shepherd) I ſweare vnto thee, that I neuer knew man in my life ſo aſſotted with ſudden loue. But as I went on my waies, and he following me at an inch, we came to a village a mile diſtant from his towne, and there, when he perceiued my rigour, &amp; that I had flatly denied him, for verie griefe and anguiſh of minde he fell ſicke. He was lodged there by a Shepherd that knew him, who as ſoone as morning came, certified his mother of his malladie. <hi>Delius</hi> mother came thither with a heauie hart in great haſte, and found her ſonne tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a burning feauer. With much ſorrow ſhe lamented his caſe, and did
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:23115:235"/>importune him to know the cauſe of his griefe, but no other anſwer would he giue her, but ſob, ſigh, and weepe. The louing mother powring forth many a bitter teare, ſaid vnto him. Oh my deere Son! what an vnfortunate chance is this? Hide not the ſecrets of thy hart from me, behold I am thy mother, and (perhaps) I knowe ſome part of them alreadie. Thy wife told me laſt night, that at the fountaine of the Sica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours thou didſt forſake her, running after I knowe not what vnknowne Shepher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, tell me if thy greefe doth grow thereby, and be not afraid nor aſhamed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to me; for ill may that malladie be cured, the cauſe and beginning whereof is vnknowne. Oh ſorrowfull <hi>Diana!</hi> thou didſt this day go to
<hi>Felicias</hi> temple to learn ſome newes of thy husband, and he was neerer to thy towne, and weaker then thou wert aware of. When <hi>Delius</hi> heard his mother ſpeake theſe words, he anſwered not a worde, but gaue a great ſigh, and then redoubled his painefull agonie. For before he complained onely of Loue, but at theſe wordes with loue and iealouſie he was moſt greeuouſlie moleſted. For when he remembred that thou <hi>(Syrenus)</hi> wert here in <hi>Felicias</hi> pallace, and hearing that <hi>Diana</hi> was come hither, fearing leaſt her olde and mortified loue might be rekindled againe in her, he fell into ſuch a frantike madnes, that, being aſſaulted with two moſt fierce and cruell torments, he ended his life in a furious traunce, vnto the greateſt greefe of his ſorrowfull mother, kinſefolkes, and lamenting friends. In very truth I could not chuſe but be ſorrowfull for his death, knowing my ſelfe to be the chiefeſt cauſe of it, but I coulde haue done no leſſe for ſafegard of mine owne content and honor. Onely one thing greeued me not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that not contenting him with any comfortable deede, I gaue him not (at the leaſt) ſome gentle words, whereby he might not then (perhaps) haue come to ſo ſudden a death. In the ende I came hither, leauing the poore ſoule dead, and his kinsfolkes weeping for him, not knowing the cauſe of his death. Thus haue I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed (yet to the purpoſe) to make thee knowe what harme a cruell diſdaine and forgetfulnes procureth, and alſo bicauſe thou ſhouldeſt vnderſtand of
<hi>Dianas</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood, and conſider with thy ſelfe, if now it were good for thee to change thine intent, ſince ſhe hath changed her condition and eſtate. But I maruell much that <hi>Diana</hi> departing from her towne yeſterday (as <hi>Delius</hi> mother ſaide) to come to this place, is not yet heere. <hi>Syrenus</hi> gaue attentiue eare to <hi>Alcidas</hi> words, and when hee heard of <hi>Delius</hi> death, his hart began ſomewhat to alter and change. There did the ſecret power alſo of ſage <hi>Felicia</hi> worke extraordinary effects, and though ſhe was not preſent there, yet with her herbes and wordes, which were of great vertue, and by many other ſupernaturall meanes, ſhe brought to paſſe that <hi>Syrenus</hi> began now againe to renewe his old loue to <hi>Diana:</hi> which was no great maruell, conſidering that by the influence of his celeſtiall conſtellation he was ſo much enclined to it, that it ſeemed
<hi>Syrenus</hi> was not borne but onely for <hi>Diana,</hi> nor <hi>Diana</hi> but for <hi>Syrenus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The prouident and moſt wiſe Ladie <hi>Felicia</hi> was now in her magnificent and rich pallace, enuironed about with her chaſte Nymphes, working with ſoueraigne and ſecret verſes the remedies, and content of all theſe Louers. And as ſhe ſawe by her diuine wiſedome, that by this time <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Alcida</hi> being by their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons deceiued, had now acknowledged their errours, and that hard harted
<hi>Syrenus</hi> had mollified his obſtinate and rigorous diſpoſition, ſhe thought it now high time vtterly to confound olde errours, and to eaſe the long trauels and troubles of her gueſtes, by exchanging them into ioyfull and vnexpected happines. Going there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of her ſumptuous pallace, attended on by <hi>Dorida, Cynthia, Polydora,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other goodly Nymphes, ſhe came to the delightfull garden, where the Lordes,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:23115:235"/>Ladies, Shepherds and Shepherdeſſes were: The firſt that ſhe ſaw there, were <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celius, Don Felix, Feliſmena, Syluanus, Seluagia, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> ſitting in one of the corners of that little ſquare meadow neere vnto the great gate, as is aforeſaide. When they ſawe the reuerend Lady comming towards them, they all roſe vp, and kiſſed thoſe hands, in which they had placed their cheefeſt hope and remedies. She courteouſly ſaluted them againe, making a ſigne vnto them that they ſhoulde all follow her, which moſt willingly they did.
<hi>Felicia</hi> attended on by this amorous traine, croſſing euery part of this great and pleaſant garden, came at the laſt to the other part of it to the fountaine, where <hi>Eugerius, Polydorus, Alcida, Clenarda, Syrenus, Arſileus, Beliſa,</hi> &amp; <hi>Montanus</hi> were. They all roſe vp, in honor of the ſage Matron. And when <hi>Alcida</hi> eſpied <hi>Marcelius, Syrenus Diana,</hi> and <hi>Montanus Iſmenta,</hi> they were all aſtoniſhed at the ſight one of another, and verily thought they were in a dreame, ſtanding like enchaunted perſons, and not beleeuing their owne eies. The wiſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die commanding them all to ſit downe againe, and ſhewing by her countenance that ſhe was to entreat of important affaires, ſat her downe in the middes of them all, in a chaire of Iuorie, grauen with gold and precious ſtones, and ſpake in this ſort. Nowe is the hower come (renowned and faire aſſemblie) wherein with my hands I meane to giue you all your long deſired and happie contentment: for by diuers ſtrange meanes, and vntroden waies I haue made you come to my Palace for no other intent and purpoſe. Since you are heere therefore altogither wel met, where the matters and meanes of your happie loue and life to come muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, my deſire is that you would follow my will, and obey my commands herein. Thou art <hi>Alcida,</hi> by the true teſtimonie and report of thy ſiſter
<hi>Clenarda,</hi> cleerelie deliuered from the ſuſpicion of thy deceiued imagination. And I knew well enough that, after thou hadſt forſaken that cruell diſdaine, the abſence of thy <hi>Marcelius</hi> did not a little greeue thee. Come hither therefore, and offer thy ſelfe vnto him, for this abſence ſhall not be long, which hath rather beene ſo ſhort, that at that time when thou complainedſt to me of it, <hi>Marcelius</hi> was in my pallace. Nowe thou haſt him heere before thee, as firme and ſtedfaſt in his firſt loue, that, if it pleaſed thee, and thy Father, brother and ſiſter, he would thinke himſelfe the happieſt man aliue, to ſolemnize this deſired marriage long ſince betrothed. The which beſides that it muſt needes cauſe great ioy and gladnes, being betweene ſuch principall and noble perſonages, ſhall make it more perfect and abſolute, by reaſon of <hi>Feliſmena</hi> his ſiſters preſence, whom
<hi>Marcelius</hi> after many yeeres paſt, hath happely found out in my Palace. Thou <hi>Montanus</hi> by <hi>Sylueria</hi> herſelfe, that betraied thee, art rid from thy erronious opinion. After which time thou didſt weep continually for the loſſe of thy faithfull wife <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> who now is come to liue &amp; die in thine armes, and to comfort all thy ſorrowes, after that thorow out all Spaine, with many a wearie iourney, and many dangers, and troubles ſhe hath ſought thee out. But now laſt of all it reſteth to remedie thy paines (faire <hi>Diana</hi>) before which time I meane to aduertiſe thee of that which <hi>Syrenus</hi> and ſome of theſe Shepherds doe know by <hi>Alcidas</hi> report, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it will be but a ſorrowfull tale in thine eares, and a grieuous coroſie to thy pitifull hart. Thy husband
<hi>Delius</hi> (faire Shepherdeſſe) as it pleaſed the inexorable deſtinies, hath ended the courſe of his life. For the loſſe whereof I know well <hi>(Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana)</hi> that thou haſt great cauſe to lament, but yet in the end all men are bound to pay this tribute to Nature, and that which is ſo common a thing, ought not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to grieue any one. Weepe not (faire
<hi>Diana</hi>) for thou breakeſt my hart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder in ſeeing thee powre forth ſuch dolorous teares, drie vp thine eies, comfort <pb n="468" facs="tcp:23115:236"/>thy ſorrowes, and cheere vp thy ſelfe. Put on no morning weeds, and make no long moan, for too much lamentation &amp; ſorrow is not allowed in this houſe, when as alſo the heauens haue reſerued for thee ſome better hap, then that which thou had'ſt of late. And ſince there is no remedie for that which is lately done, it belongeth to thy wiſedom to forget what is paſt, and to my skill &amp; power, to giue order to things preſent. Heere is thy old louer <hi>Syrenus,</hi> whoſe hart by my operations, and by the reaſon that bindes him to it, is become ſo tender, gentle, and chaunged from his former hardnes, that now for his great contentment, it onely behooueth him to conclude a marriage with thee. That which I requeſt of thee is, that thou wilt obay my will in a thing which ſo greatly concerneth thy happie and ioyfull life: The which, although it may ſeeme to offer ſome iniurie to thy husband that is dead to marrie ſo ſoone againe; yet being a thing practiſed by my decree and autoritie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not any waies be deemed ill. And thou <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſince thou haſt begun to giue place in thy hart to honeſt and vertuous Loue, make now an ende to yeelde vp thy thoughts and deeds to it: and let this merie and happie mariage be put in effect, to the fulfilling of which, all the fauourable ſtars are inclined. The reſt of you, which in this delightfull garden enioy your happie content, reioice in your minds; make merie paſtimes; play vpon your tuned inſtruments; ſing ſweete Ditties, and exerciſe your ſelues in delightfull ſports and conuerſation, in honour and memory of theſe ioyfull meetings, and happie marriages. Sage <hi>Felicia</hi> had no ſooner ended her ſpeech, but all of them were verie willing to do as ſhe commanded them, liking well of her motion, and maruelling at her ſingular wiſedome. <hi>Montanus</hi> tooke his wife <hi>Iſmenia</hi> by the hand, thinking themſelues thriſe happie and fortunate; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Marcelius</hi> and <hi>Alcida, Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> at that inſtant a holy and virtuous marriage was ſolemnly celebrated with great loue, firmnes, and ſumptuous accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ceremonies.</p>
               <p>All the reſt exceeding glad for theſe happie accidents, ſung and reioiced with maruellous applauſe. Amongſt the which,
<hi>Arſileus</hi> for the great good will that he bare to <hi>Syrenus,</hi> and for the friendſhip betweene them both, at the ſound of his Rebecke, ſung this Caroll in memorie and ioy of the new marriage betweene
<hi>Syrenus</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi>

After that they had a pretie while delighted themſelues in this kinde of exerciſe, <hi>Felicia</hi> thinking it time to go to dinner, commanded that it ſhoulde be brought to the fountaine where they were. Whoſe commaunde the Nymphes obeying, preſently buſied themſelues ſeuerally to prouide for dinner; and ſetting the tables and cupbordes of plate vnder the ſhadowe of thoſe greene trees, euerie one ſitting in order as <hi>Felicia</hi> appointed them, beganne to taſte of thoſe delicate and daintie meates that were ſerued in, and moſt of them in plate of great value.

               <p>While <hi>Diana</hi> was ſinging her ſong, there came a moſt beautifull Shepherdeſſe to the fountaine, but newly (as it ſeemed) come to <hi>Felicias</hi> Palace, and being tolde, that the Ladie was in the garden, ſhe came thither to ſee her and to talke with her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the place where <hi>Felicia</hi> was, ſhe kneeling downe before her, kiſſed her hands, and ſaid vnto her. Pardon (good Lady) my boldnes, for comming into this preſence without leaue, ſince the deſire I had to ſee you, and the neede which I haue of your skill and wiſedome, was ſo great, that I was forced hereunto. I bring with <pb n="472" facs="tcp:23115:238"/>me my hart ſurcharged with greefe, the remedie whereof is onely in your handes, but it is ſo great, that it requireth ſome fitter time, occaſion, and place to tell it at large, bicauſe it is againſt good manners to interrupt this merrie companie with matter of ſorrow and greefe. <hi>Meliſea</hi> (for ſo was this Shepherdeſſe called) was yet on her knees before
<hi>Felicia,</hi> when ſhe perceiued a Shepherd comming along in an Alley of the Orchard towards the fountaine, and in ſeeing him, ſaide. This is an other greefe (good Ladie) ſo troubleſome and painfull vnto me, that for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the ſame alſo, I haue no leſſe neede of your gracious helpe and fauour. By this time the Shepherd (whoſe name was
<hi>Narciſus</hi>) came in preſence of <hi>Felicia,</hi> and of thoſe Lordes and Ladies that were with her, and making lowe obeiſance, he began to make a great complaint againſt the Shepherdeſſe <hi>Meliſea</hi> that was preſent there, ſaying, that he ſuffered great torments for her ſake, and receiued not from her again one fauourable or gentle word: Inſomuch that in purſute of her loue and company to that place, he had come very farre, and ſhe not ſuffred him ſo much as to declare his greefe to her cruell and diſdainfull eares. <hi>Felicia</hi> commanded
<hi>Meliſea</hi> to riſe vp, and cutting off their troubleſome contentions, ſaide. It is not now time to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to long and tedious complaints, wherefore be content for this time <hi>Meliſea</hi> and giue
<hi>Narciſus</hi> thy hand, and go both into that dance, and for the reſt wee will heereafter finde out a remedie at fitter time. The Shepherdeſſe would not gain ſaie the Ladies command, but hand in hand with
<hi>Narciſus</hi> ſhe went to dance with the other Shepherds. And at this time happie <hi>Iſmenia</hi> that was readie to ſing, ſhewing by her outward countenance ſignes of inward content, which after ſo long ſorrow ſhe inioyed, ſung in this ſort.</p>

               <p>The Shepherds would haue ſung one verſe or two more, when a goodly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of faire Nymphes (as <hi>Felicia</hi> had appointed) came to the fountaine, and euerie one playing vpon her ſeuerall inſtrument, made ſtrange and delightfull harmonie. One of them plaied on a Lute; another on a Harpe; another made a maruellous ſweet countertenour vpon a Recorder; another with a peece of a fine quil made the ſiluer ſtringed Cyterne ſweetely to ſound; others the ſtringes of the baſe Viall with roſined haires; others with Virginals and Violins made delicate changes in the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:23115:240"/>aire, and filled it with ſo ſweete muſicke, that in a manner it aſtoniſhed them that heard it, and made them to maruell no leſſe at it. Theſe Nymphes were ſtrangely apparelled, and paſſing faire to behold, euerie one in her proper colours, their locks of golden haire hanging looſe to the wauering winde, with fine coronets on their heads, and ſweete flowers tied togither with threds of gold and ſiluer. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſeeing this melodious quier of angels, left of the daunce that they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and ſat downe, giuing attentiue eare to the heauenly muſicke, and concent of the ſundrie ſweete inſtruments that they plaied on, which ioyned ſometimes with cleere and delicate voices, mooued ſtrange and rare delight. Then came out by and by ſixe Nymphes apparelled with crimoſin Satten, embrodered with flowers &amp; leaues of gold and ſiluer, wearing rich caules vpon their heads, which were filled and wrought with Rubies and Emerauldes, from the which hung downe vpon their faireſt browes Diamantes of incomparable value, with pendants at their eares, of the rareſt Pearles and richeſt Diamonds that could be founde. They had crymoſin Buskins on their legs that were finely printed and gilt, with their bowes in their hands, and their quiuers of arrowes hanging behinde their ſhoulders. In this ſort they began to dance to the ſound that the inſtruments made, but with ſo braue a grace, that it was a rare ſight to behold them. And being in the middes of their dance, there lept out on the ſudden a ſtately white Hart, marked all ouer with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blacke ſpots, which ſeemed very pleaſant to the eie: his painted hornes with golde were large, high, and branchie. In breefe it was ſuch an one, as <hi>Felicia</hi> could beſt deuiſe to make that companie ſport. When the Nymphes eſpied the Hart, they ranne rounde about him, and dancing neuertheleſſe without miſſing one ſtraine of the muſicke that plaied ſtill, with a braue concord they began to ſhoote at him, the which leaping from one ſide to another after the arrowes were once flien out, with manie nimble and pretie skips did the beſt to defend himſelfe. But after they had a pretie while ſported themſelues with this paſtime, the Hart beganne to breake out from them amongſt the orchards and courts, the Nymphes purſuing him amaine, vntill they chaſed him out of the Garden, who with their ioyfull cries and pleaſant hallowing made a delicate noiſe, which the other Nymphes &amp; Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſeconded with their voices, taking a moſt ſingular delight in this dance. And with this ſport the Nymphes made an end of their muſicke. In the meane time ſage <hi>Felicia,</hi> bicauſe there ſhould not want ſome profitable leſſon to be gathered out of thoſe pleaſures for the direction and inſtruction of life, meaning to trie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits about the obſcure myſteries and ſignifications of that dance, ſaide to <hi>Diana.</hi> Canſt thou tell me (faire Shepherdeſſe) what is ment by the chaſe of this goodlie Hart, beſides the thing it ſelfe? To whom ſhe ſaide againe, I am not ſo wiſe (gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ladie) that I am able to expounde myſteries, nor to diſſolue your hard queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

The Hart is mans hart, made faire with delicate thoughts, and rich with quiet content. It ſubmitteth it ſelfe to humane inclinations, which ſhoote mortall arrowes at it, but with diſcretion remoouing it ſelfe into diuers parts, and applying it ſelfe to honeſt exerciſes, it muſt defend it ſelfe from ſo many hurtfull arrowes, that ayme ſo cruelly at it. And when it is purſued of them, it muſt flie away ſpeedilie, thereby to ſaue it ſelfe, though thoſe humane and fraile inclinations which ſhoote ſuch arrowes, will not ceaſe to purſue it, and will neuer leaue to accompanie it, vntill it eſcapes out of the orchard of life. How can I vnderſtand (ſaide <hi>Diana</hi>) ſo difficult and Morall a concluſion, as this, when as the queſtions and Riddles which wee <pb n="477" facs="tcp:23115:240"/>Shepherdeſſes exerciſe and diſport our ſelues with (to this but plaine and eaſie) I could neuer yet diſſolue nor expound. Make not thy ſelfe ſo vnskilfull (ſaide
<hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagia</hi>) ſince I haue knowne the contrarie in thee, and that there was neuer any Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſo hard, but was eaſie enough in thy vnderſtanding. In good time (ſaide <hi>Felicia</hi>) for now we may wel try her cunning, which paſtime wil affoord no leſſe delight then the other before. Propound her therfore euery one of you a Riddle, for I know <hi>Diana</hi> will acquite herſelfe with you all. It liked them all well; but <hi>Diana,</hi> who had not ſuch confidence in her cunning, that ſhe durſt oppoſe her skil to ſuch difficult queſtions as ſhe thought they woulde propounde, but bicauſe ſhe woulde obey <hi>Felicia</hi> and pleaſe her
<hi>Syrenus,</hi> who ſeemed to take a pride and delight therein, ſhe was content to take in hand the charge that they impoſed vpon hir.
<hi>Syluanus,</hi> who was very ready in propounding of Riddles, made the firſt, ſaying. Bicauſe I know well (faire Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe) that thy pregnant and liuely wit is able to diſcouer hard and hidden mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that thy skill is no leſſe ſufficient to compaſſe and attaine to intricate and high things, I will therefore (by thy fauour) aske thee a queſtion, by anſwering which, I know thou wilt manifeſt thy delicate and ripe wit.

And if you are too peruerſe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in your opinion, it ſhall not be amiſſe to rehearſe it to you, to make you leaue of your blinde errour.

<hi>Beliſa</hi> ſo cholericke, and made no ſmall ſport thereat. In the end old <hi>Eugerius</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Polydorus,</hi> bicauſe they would not be depriued of that merrie ſong which they expected at

Whereupon all of them went towards it, and being come to the riuer ſide, they ſaw twelue little ſhips comming in two ſeuerall nauies from the riuer beneath, brauely depainted with diuers colours, and verie richly ſet forth. Sixe of them bore ſailes of white and crimoſin damaske, and their diſplayed flags in the tops, &amp; ſtreamers in their poupes
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:23115:246"/>of the ſame colours: And the other ſixe, their ſailes, flagges, and ſtreamers of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey ſattin with yellow ſhrouds and tackling to the ſame. Their oares were brauely gilt all ouer; and they came decked, ſtrowed, and adorned with many ſweete flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and garlands of Roſes. In euerie one of them were ſixe Nymphes apeece, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled with ſhort moreſco gownes: they of the one fleete with crimoſin veluet laid on with ſiluer lace and fringe; and they of the other, of murrey veluet embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with curious workemanſhip of gold, hauing on their armes a ſleeue of golde and ſiluer made fit vnto them, and carrying their targets on their armes after the manner of the valiant Amazones. They that rowed theſe fiue ſhips, were certaine Sauages, crowned with garlands of Roſes, and bound to their ſeats with chaines of ſiluer. There aroſe amongſt them a great noiſe of drums, trumpets, ſhagbotes, cornets, and of many other ſorts of muſicke; at ſound of which two and two togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with a maruellous ſweete concent keeping iuſt time and meaſure, entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the riuer, which cauſed great woonder in them that looked on. After this they parted themſelues into two nauies, and out of both of them one ſhip apeece of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and anſwere came out, the reſt remayning beholders on either ſide. In each of theſe two ſhips came a Sauage apparelled with the colours of his owne ſide, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding bolt vpright in the forecaſtle, carrying on his left arme a ſhield, which couered him from top to toe, and in his right hand a launce, painted with the ſelfe ſame co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. They both at one time hoyſted ſaile, and with force of oares ran one againſt the other with great furie. The Nymphes and Sauages, and they that fauoured each partie, made great ſhootes and cries to encourage their ſides. They that ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, emploied all their force, the one ſide and the other ſtriuing to ſaile with greater violence, and to make the ſtronger encounter. And the Sauages being welny met togither, and armed with their targets and launces, it was the greateſt delight in the world to ſee how they were encouraged to this encounter, and how they ſped in it: For they ſtoode not ſo ſurely, nor had not ſo great dexteritie in their fight, but that with the great violence that the ſhips met one another, and with the puſhes that they gaue with their launces vpon their targets, they were not able to ſtande on their feete, ſometimes falling downe vpon the hatches, and ſometimes into the riuer. Wherewith the laughter of them on the ſhoare encreaſed, and the reioycing and triumphes of them, whoſe ſide had done beſt, and the muſicke to encourage them on both ſides. The iuſters, when they fell into the water, went ſwimming vp and downe, vntill being helped by the Nymphes on whoſe ſide they fought, they made a freſh encounter, and falling into the water againe, redoubled the laughing of the beholders, and the ſport with exceeding glee and meriment. In the end the ſhip with white and crimoſin ſailes came on ſo faſt, and with ſuch force, and her champion ſo ſteadie in his place, that he ſtoode ſtill on foote, bearing downe his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie before him into the riuer. Which when the Nymphes of his ſquadron per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, made ſuch triumphe, with hallowing, and ringing ſuch a ſtrange peale of muſicke, that the other ſide was halfe abaſhed, and daſht from any farther enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: But eſpecially one proude and ſtoute Sauage amongſt the reſt, who, being ſomwhat aſhamed and angrie at their foile, ſaid. Is it poſſible that there is any in our company of ſo ſmall courage and ſtrength, that is not able to abide ſo feeble and light blowes? Vnlocke this chaine from my legs, and let him that hath prooued himſelfe ſo weake a iuſter, row in my place, and you ſhall ſee how I will make you conquerours, and confound our enemies in their owne fooliſh triumph. He had no ſooner ſaide the word, but deliuered from his chaine by a Nymphe, with a braue <pb n="492" facs="tcp:23115:247"/>courage he tooke his launce and target, and manfully ſtood vpright in the prow of the ſhip. Then the Sauages with valiant mindes began to row on both ſides, and the Nymphes to make loude voices in the aire. The contrarie ſhip came with the ſame force as before, but her Sauage had little need to ſet his ſtaffe in reſt to get the victorie; for the champion that had braued it ſo much, before they met, with the great force and haſte that the ſhip carryed him, could not poſſibly keepe himſelfe on foote, but that with ſhield and ſpeare he fell into the water, giuing a manifeſt and cleere example, <hi>That the proudeſt and moſt preſumptuous fall most often into greatest diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces.</hi> The Nymphes tooke him vp againe (who went ſwimming vp and downe) although he little deſerued it: But the fiue other ſhips ſpoken of before, remaining aſide by themſelues, ſeeing their captaine ouercommed, what with choler, ſhame, and deſire to regaine the victorie, and their loſt honours, came all ruſhing out at once. The other fiue of white and crimoſin did the like, and then the Nymphes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred them in throwing perfumed pellets and muskebals of white and red waxe, and painted egſhels full of orange and roſe water, making ſuch a ſhrill ſhoute, and fighting with ſo good order and valour, that there they brauely figured a ſhip yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelfe, as if it had beene ſo in good earneſt. At the end whereof the ſhips with the murrey colours ſhewed themſelues ouercommed with ſtriking ſaile, &amp; yeelded to the other Nymphes, who like valiant conquerours leaped into them by and by, and then with the ſame muſicke as before, came to the riuer banks, where they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarked the conquerours, and thoſe that were vanquiſhed, with the Sauages their captiues, making a goodly ſhew with their ſeuerall and ſingular beauties. When this ſport was finiſhed, <hi>Felicia</hi> with <hi>Eugerius,</hi> &amp; the other companie following them, went backe againe to the fountaine, where they were no ſooner come, but they found a Shepherd, that during all the time of the fight by water, had beene in the orchard, and had ſitten neere vnto the fountaine. He ſeemed verie comely and gracious in all their eies, but eſpecially in <hi>Felicias,</hi> who knew him incontinently, and ſaid thus vnto him.</p>
               <p>Thou couldeſt not haue come at a better time
<hi>(Turianus)</hi> for remedie of thy greefes, and for encreaſe of this ſolace and ſport. We will hereafter take care for thy greefe, and helpe it at fitter time, as for the reſt, thou muſt ſhew this goodly companie, how much thou canſt delight with thy ſweete ſinging. For now I ſee, thee with thy Rebecke out of thy ſcrip, as though thou wouldeſt pleaſe this faire companie, ſing ſomething of thy <hi>Elumia;</hi> for thou ſhalt for this ſeruice ſee thy ſelfe hereafter well ſatisfied and contented. The Shepherd was amazed to heare <hi>Felicia</hi> call him by his name, and the Shepherdeſſe his loue by hers, and that ſhe promiſed him ſome lightning of his paine: Wherefore meaning to requite ſuch offers with rather obeying her commaund, then onely with ſimple thankes to gratifie them, all of them being ſet, and keeping ſilence, he began to play a while on his Rebecke, and to ſing that which followeth.</p>

And ſhe being beloued of thee, it cannot be otherwiſe imagined, but that her perfections of bodie and vertues of minde are moſt rare and excellent. And that which doth not a little helpe to the accompliſhment of her gifts, is the delight and dexteritie that ſhe hath in hunting, for which thou didſt compare her with <hi>Diana;</hi> bicauſe it is one of the braue qualities which make both Nymphes and Shepherdeſſes to be thought more beautifull and gracious, and moſt worthie of golden praiſes: For I my ſelfe did ſometime know a Shepherd in our towne, and my <hi>Iſmenia</hi> and <hi>Seluagia</hi> knew him alſo verie well; who being enamoured of a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe (called <hi>Argia</hi>) was with none of her paſſing graces more captiuated, then with her ſingular cunning in ſhooting and delight that ſhe had in her bowe, which was continually in her hande, and her quiuer of ſteely headed arrowes at her backe, wherewith ſhee hunted, wounded, and killed, the nymble footed Does, wilde beaſtes, and ſimple birdes.

               <p>This Sonnet was maruellous delightfull to them all, and the ſweetnes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Montanus</hi> ſung it, a great deale more. And after they had diſcourſed of euery particular part and matter of it,
<hi>Felicia</hi> ſeeing the night came on, and thinking ſhe
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:23115:249"/>had feaſted and ſported her gueſts that day ſufficiently, made a ſigne by her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that ſhe would ſay ſomething; whereupon they left of their mirth and talke for a while, and with attentiue mindes harkened vnto her: and ſilence being kept, with her accuſtomed grauitie, ſhe thus began to ſpeake.</p>
               <p>I am vndoubtedly perſwaded (noble Lordes and Ladies, and you worthy Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds) that, ſince the time that you came to my houſe, you haue no cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of my fauours beſtowed on you, nor of the diligence and ſeruice of my Nymphes employed for your ſakes. For the deſire which I had to pleaſe you all, was ſo great, and the delight which I take to helpe diſtreſſed men to their contentment, ſo proper to my nature, that (me thinks) if I had done a great deale more for you, it had bin but little in reſpect of that which your virtues deſerue. Onely <hi>Narciſus</hi> with the crueltie of <hi>Meliſea,</hi> and <hi>Turianus</hi> with the diſdaine of <hi>Eluinia,</hi> remaine diſcontent amongſt you all. Whom it ſhall now ſatisfie to comfort themſelues with hope of their future felicities, ſince that my word (which was neuer ſtained with deceit and lye) hath aſſuredly promiſed them a ſpeedie and full contentment by thoſe meanes which ſhall be moſt expedient for them. I ſee old
<hi>Engerius</hi> glad with his ſonne, his daughters, and his ſonne in law, and not without cauſe, ſince for loue of them he hath paſſed ſo many dangers, and ſuffered ſuch extreme paine, ſorrow, and anguiſh of minde.
<hi>Felicia</hi> hauing ended her ſpeech, <hi>Eugerius</hi> wondered greatly at her wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the reſt were ſatisfied and well content with ſo gentle and courteous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, wherby they gathered out of them profitable leſſons to lead from thence forth a virtuous and happie life. And ſo all of them riſing from their places about the fountaine, and following the ſage Ladie, went out of the garden into the Palace, euerie one to their ſeuerall lodgings, accommodating their mindes to the ioyfull feaſts &amp; princely ſports of the next day following: The which, and that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to <hi>Narciſus, Turianus, Tauriſus,</hi> and
<hi>Berardus,</hi> with the delectable hiſtorie of <hi>Danteus,</hi> and
<hi>Duarda</hi> the <hi>Portugale</hi> Shepherds (which for certaine reſpects is omitted heere) and many other things of great delight, pleaſure, and profit, are handled in the ſecond Part of this Booke.</p>
